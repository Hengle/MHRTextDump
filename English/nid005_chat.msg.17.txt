<string>The Rampage comes... I hope<lf>you're prepared.
<string>A successful defense. Now, back to<lf>the village, there is more work to be done.
<string>We're overrun... Get out of here!
<string>That will do for now.<lf>Let's head back.
<string>The Stronghold is in ruins...<lf>This was only a half victory.
<string>Mission complete?<lf>I expected nothing less.
<string>You've completed all missions?<lf>...Well done.
<string>There's a new mission for you.<lf>Go take care of it.
<string>A wave is coming. We can't let<lf>it get past us...
<string>There's not much time until the<lf>next horde is here. Get ready.
<string>This is the last one.<lf>Brace yourself.
<string>A gate is under attack!<lf>The horde must not pass!
<string>Our defenses were destroyed!<lf>Pay attention!
<string>They've breached the inner<lf>courtyard! Stop them!
<string>The last gate!<lf>Defend it with your life!
<string>The final gate will soon fall!<lf>Were we underprepared...!?
<string>That monster will destroy<lf>the Stronghold. Do not let it.
<string>It's specifically targeting hunters.<lf>Be on your guard.
<string>This one attacks from afar.<lf>Don't take your eyes off it.
<string>It shows itself at last...<lf>Ibushi! Get down here and fight!
<string>Monsters are attacking.<lf>We WILL hold them off.
<string>A vicious foe approaches.<lf>I hope we're ready...
<string>A power flows through me...<lf>Ready your weapons for attack!
<string>A power flows through me...<lf>We must destroy them!
<string>An installation's destroyed...<lf>We'll have it fixed soon.
<string>An Apex, hm? Well... Slay it<lf>and the horde will disperse.
<string>The Apex is about to attack.<lf>Stay calm, and deal with it.
<string>The power of an Apex!<lf>It-It's utterly devastating!
<string>Was that an Apex's roar?<lf>The horde is maddened by it!
<string>The Apex is destroying the<lf>Stronghold! Filthy, no good...
<string>It isn't over yet... I'll be<lf>waiting for your return.
<string>Good. That installation seems<lf>to do the job.
<string>Hmph... That one doesn't quite<lf>hit the mark.
<string>Great work out there. You've put<lf>the fight back into everyone.
<string>Brawling left and right, huh?<lf>Just like Fugen back in the day.
<string><PL>...<lf>You give Kamura hope.
<string>You disperse Kamura's darkness.<lf>You're our light, and our hero.
<string><PL>, our<lf>defense needs you.
<string>Don't falter! Just follow Fugen's<lf>orders and we WILL succeed!
