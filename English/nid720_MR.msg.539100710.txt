<string>Could you help meow-t?
<string>"Scrub the deck, scrub it good~♪"<lf>Ahoy, Hunter! I have a little favor to<lf>ask ya! Think you can help meow-t?
<string>Nagi over at the Buddy Piazza is having<lf>a gatherer upgrade campaign and I'm<lf>helping to promote it.
<string>All you gotta do is complete three master rank<lf>quests with a Gathering-type Palico and your<lf>Palicoes will gain access to a new move!
<string>I'm not a Palico, but I wonder if I can use<lf>it to get rid of those squawking seagulls! <lf>"Scrub the deck, scrub it good~♪"
<string>Great work meow-t there!
<string>Ahoy, Hunter! Thanks for helping promote<lf>the campaign! Your Palicoes did great!<lf>Oh, and you too, of course!
<string>Meow your Palicoes have a new Secret<lf>Support Move at their disposal! Some<lf>kind of litter box?
<string>Oh! It's a LOTTERY Box. My bad. Well,<lf>I hope your Palicoes have good luck<lf>using it! I know I sure could use some!

<string>"Scrub the deck, scrub it good~♪"<lf>"Clean the bird poop from the wood~♪"<lf>Ahoy, Hunter! Have a nice boat ride, didja?
<string>Of course ya did! This fine vessel is my<lf>purr-ide and joy! Cleanest ship in the<lf>whole fleet!
<string>Just to be clear, I don't own this ship...<lf>But I clean her like she's mine!
<string>But someday... Someday I'll captain my<lf>own ship. And I'll have a whole crew to<lf>keep her clean!
<string>Im-purr-essed with the way I wield<lf>my brush, huh?
<string>Are ya scoutin' me to be one of your Buddies?<lf>Ha! Sorry, Hunter. The only thing I'm fighting<lf>are those squawking seagulls circling above.
<string>After I finish up here, I gotta go clean up<lf>the stern. They don't call it a poop deck<lf>for nothing!
<string>What kind of ships do you Kamura folk<lf>have? And, more importantly, are they<lf>easy to clean?
<string>Just wondering, mew'know? When I build<lf>meow-n ship, I want to sail the thing, not<lf>work my paws to the bone keeping it clean!
<string>*sigh* My own ship... Mew.<lf>Makes me excited just thinking about it!<lf>"Scrub the deck, scrub it good~♪"
<string>"Scrub the deck, scrub it good~♪"<lf>"Clean the— Hmmm...<lf>Rhythms off...
<string>Looks like it's time fur a new brush.
<string>While you're out shellacking meownsters,<lf>I'll be here shellacking this deck.
<string>Gotta keep this ship in tip-top shape<lf>for our top hunter!
<string>Every so often Flur will have a paw-fully<lf>sad look in his eyes... I know that feeling<lf>all too well.
<string>Lunch time never comes soon enough...
<string>Wait! Don't step there! Russeau was<lf>just up here and, well... You know how<lf>he gets when he comes aboard.
<string>What kind of sailor can't keep his lunch<lf>down when he's on deck?<lf>Mew...
<string>Ahoy, Hunter! Fine job out there cleaning<lf>up those meownsters! Are you thinking<lf>about taking a break?
<string>Mew'know, I'm gonna take one right<lf>after I finish scrubbing this deck!<lf>Whenever THAT is!
<string>Brushes to bristles! Someone's being<lf>chased by a big meownster!?
<string>I can handle being chased by seagulls,<lf>but meownsters!? I don't even want to<lf>think about being in that situation!
<string>I see you just got back fur-om hunting<lf>meownsters in the Flooded Fur-est...<lf>How did I know?
<string>Let's just say that the deck used to<lf>be clean be-fur you tracked mud and<lf>meownster guts all over it!
<string>Ahoy, Hun— Whoa! Be careful, meow!<lf>The deck's still a little slippery after I<lf>polished it. You did slip on polish, right?
<string>Anymew, that was a close one! It'd be<lf>unfurtunate if you hurt yourself before<lf>your next important quest!
<string>Mew'know, with Flur working at the juice<lf>stand all day, I'm starting to miss him<lf>a little...
<string>It gets kinda lonely scrubbing sometimes—<lf>I just got the best idea! What if we open<lf>a stand on the deck?
<string>—What? Am I sure it's a good idea?<lf>Why wouldn't I—oh... OH! Right...<lf>THEM.
<string>Ahoy, Hunter! Off to hunt an Aurora Somnacanth?<lf>Mew'know a lot of sailors say they remind them<lf>of their sweethearts back on land...
<string>I think they've been meow-t on the sea<lf>a little too long...
<string>Ahoy, Hunter! So...what are these Qurio<lf>thingies everyone's mewing about?
<string>Creatures that fly around and cause<lf>chaos everywhere they go, huh? And<lf>they always leave a big mess behind...
<string>So... Everyone's fur-eaking out about<lf>seagulls? They're NOT seagulls?<lf>But you said—!
<string>"Scrub the deck, scrub it good~♪"<lf>Take a look at this, Hunter. Have<lf>you seen anything like this befur?
<string>I mean, I eat fish all the time, but<lf>I never leave a mess like THIS!<lf>Mew...
<string>It's gonna take all nine lives fur me<lf>to clean this up! Grrrrrr! Squawking<lf>seagulls!
<string>"Scrub the deck, scrub it good—"<lf>Ahoy, Hunter! I heard we have a<lf>doctor here in the Meowtpost meow!
<string>And apparently he's an ex-purr-t herbalist!<lf>I wonder if after he finishes making his<lf>medicine I could ask him a favor...
<string>Mew'know, scrubbing all day really does<lf>a number on my back. You think he can<lf>whip up something fur me?
<string>Brushes to bristles! I heard you got<lf>attacked by Meow-zeno! Are you OK?
<string>The deck is still clean, so I guess that's<lf>a yes?
<string>Well, that's a relief! I spent all day cleaning<lf>it—Oh! A-And I'm glad you're not hurt too!<lf>"Scrub the deck, scrub it good~♪"
<string>You defeated Meow-zeno and lived<lf>to tell the tail!
<string>Mew'know, I was so worried about you<lf>that I couldn't scrub. Hard to believe<lf>but it's one hundred purr-cent true!
<string>Just look at the deck! Oh, and be careful<lf>where you step! Well, I gotta get back to<lf>work! "Scrub the deck, scrub it good~♪"
<string>Mew'know, Hunter, I was thinking...<lf>Why don't we investigate all these<lf>squawking seagulls?
<string>If you ask me, they're a lot worse than<lf>meownsters. At least meownster poop<lf>is useful!
<string>If you want my ex-purr-t opinion, anything<lf>that flies around and gathers in large<lf>numbers is trouble just waiting to happen!
<string>Don't matter what it is—Qurio, seagulls—<lf>the outcome is the same. One big mess.
<string>Brushes to bristles! To think such<lf>a scary meownster is out there!
<string>Does that mean it's time for us to join<lf>forces!? Hunters and sailors mew-nite!<lf>And with your strength and my brush...
<string>Elgado has nothing to fear! I'm ready to<lf>purr-otect this ship with all of my nine<lf>lives—Hmmm... Wait a minute...
<string>Purr-otecting Elgado is important, but<lf>if I take a break fur-om cleaning this<lf>deck, those squawking seagulls...
<string>So you mopped the floor with that<lf>legendary meownster, huh!?
<string>If you keep this up, you'll be a legend<lf>yourself! Do you think there will ever be<lf>any tails about me? Something like...
<string>"There once was a legendary Felyne<lf>who fought a heroic battle against<lf>a relentless enemy...!"
<string>Brushes to bristles! I guess no one is<lf>safe fur-om those squawking seagulls!<lf>Even poor Chichae can't escape 'em!
<string>She had JUST finished cleaning her<lf>glasses, too. Right as she put 'em<lf>back on her face... Splat.
<string>"Scrub the deck, scrub it good~♪"<lf>"Clean the bird poop from the wood~♪"<lf>"Scrub it good, scrub it right~♪"
<string>Mew'know, I bet you'd be purr-etty<lf>good with a brush. Hunting must be<lf>amazing for your pawceps!
<string>Mew'know, sometimes I take a break<lf>fur-om scrubbing and stare off into<lf>the horizon...
<string>I wonder, "What's out there? Is there<lf>something out there fur me?"<lf>......
<string>And you know what's out there, Hunter?<lf>Purr-obably just more squawking seagulls!<lf>"Scrub the deck, scrub it good~♪"
<string>Mew'know, Hunter. I don't just clean<lf>the decks, I also maintain the ship's<lf>armaments.
<string>I keep my paws off the ballistae while<lf>we're in port though. I'd be too tempted<lf>to use 'em on those squawking seagulls!
<string>Am I kidding? Ha—... O-Of course!<lf>I would never do such a thing...<lf>Never... "Scrub the deck~♪"
<string>I tell ya, work is never-ending for a Felyne<lf>paw-y with a brush 'round here! These<lf>squawking seagulls...I swear.
<string>Nowhere is safe with those blasted birds<lf>flying around. It seems like as soon as<lf>I finish scrubbing the ship...
<string>I gotta go scrub somewhere else.
<string>Mew'know, I haven't seen Flur this happy<lf>in a while. And he keeps going on and<lf>on about having "big plans."
<string>What's that all about? You don't know<lf>either, huh? Hmmm...
<string>My birthday's not coming up anytime<lf>soon. I wonder what his "big plans"<lf>are...
