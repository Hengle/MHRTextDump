<string>Hya! Ha! Hwaa!
<string>Taaake this!
<string>One, two, hyaa!
<string>Real monsters should be a bit<lf>tougher than this!
<string>Come on, is that all you got!?
<string>Oof... That hurt!
<string>This toad's givin' me the creeps!
<string>A-Aaah! That was a close one!
<string>I'm fixin' to Wyvern Ride you,<lf>Toadface!
<string>One, two! One, two!
<string>Left paw, right paw.
<string>I'm not done yet!
<string>To hunt, one must first run!
<string>I have to train these legs<lf>so I can run from monsters.
<string>One day, I'm gonna be even<lf>faster than a Pala-mewt!
<string>Just...keep...running...
<string>One, two. Mew...<lf>I'm pooped.
<string>After this, I'm gonna get my<lf>paws on some Bunny Dango...
<string>I got a whole bunch this time.
<string>Diving in a submarine makes you<lf>feel like an expurr-lorer.
<string>We want a big ol' boat like<lf>the Argosy too, mew know.
<string>Traveling all around is a big<lf>purr-k of the job.
<string>There are some cool places out there.
<string>Meooow-ho-ho!<lf>A-sailing we will go!
<string>I was so surprised!<lf>I didn't know fish got that big!
<string>Submarines are oddly cozy!
<string>The fresh air smells sweet!
<string>Zzz...
<string>*yawn* Zzz...
<string>Oooh, I'm stuffed...
<string>If I catch a Wirebug,<lf>I can Wiredash too!
<string>I'm gonna get a bunch of bugs!
<string>When they flutter by...<lf>I just...lose myself.
<string>Oh, oh my!<lf>What a wonderful smell...
<string>I-I can't stop drooling!
<string>Meow ho! Meow ho!<lf>Making lots of dango!
<string>Pssst...did you hear?
<string>I know, I know...!
<string>Master Utsushi did what...?
<string>The key to a good hunt is rest<lf>and relaxation.
<string>I love sunny spots...
<string>When the hunting gets tough,<lf>just team up with furr-iends.
<string>I try to keep mew-ving so<lf>I don't get out of shape.
<string>Mew-ve that body!
<string>Maybe I can invent a skill.
<string>Covert opurr-ation in<lf>purr-rogress...
<string>I am one with the shadows...
<string>You do not see anything.<lf>You cannot see a thing.
<string>Take that!
<string>Ha! Hyaaaa!
<string>One, two, hyaa!
<string>I'm not done with you!
<string>I won't lose!
<string>That thing hurts!
<string>It's scary when it mew-ves!
<string>Yikes!
<string>I see an opening!
<string>Endurance training!
<string>I'm going as fast as I can!
<string>I can go farther!
<string>Long runs are a must.
<string>Practicing how to flee<lf>is Para-meow-nt!
<string>Like the wind!
<string>Can I take a break soon?
<string>I'm beat...
<string>My tummy's grumbling.
<string>I got a whole buncha stuff.
<string>I love trading.
<string>So much stuff.
<string>So romeown-tic.
<string>Is it trading you seek?
<string>Meooow-ho-ho!
<string>Trading is my calling.
<string>Back into the cozy ship!
<string>I can't wait to dive again.
<string>Zzzz.
<string>I'm stuffed...
<string>I'm catching Wirebugs.
<string>Gathering is vital to hunting.
<string>I got one!
<string>What a wonderful smell...
<string>*drool*
<string>Meow ho! Meow ho!
<string>Pssst...
<string>She didn't...!
<string>That's the spot...
<string>So snug!
<string>Phew...
<string>Gotta stay fit.
<string>Ready to hunt.
<string>I'm honing my skills!
<string>I'm hiding...
<string>You can't see me...
<string>Ruff! Ruff!
<string>Woo-oof!
<string>Arf arf!
<string>*pant*
<string>Woof woof.
<string>Arf!
<string>*whimper*
<string>Woof.
<string>Woof woof.
<string>Zzz...
<string>*pant*
<string>Awoo.
