<string>"Here comes the Rampage!"<lf>"Oh no, what are we gonna do!?"<lf>"It's almost upon the village!"
<string>That's when I'll run to the gates, slam<lf>'em shut, and hit the lock! And then<lf>I'll say, "Try gettin' in now, suckers!"
<string>Oh, <PL>!
<string>I was just practicing what I'd do<lf>if the Rampage came. You know,<lf>running through the steps and stuff.
<string>Let's talk later, OK?
<string>Hey! Hey! <PL>!<lf>Is it true that you're a hunter now!?<lf>Wooow, that's so cool!
<string>Listen. I see everyone who comes in<lf>and out of Kamura since my shop is<lf>parked in front of the main gates.
<string>You can count on me to keep a keen<lf>eye on things in Kamura while you're<lf>out hunting. 'K?
<string>You may be a hunter, and that's cool<lf>and all, but I've got a pretty cool job<lf>too!
<string>A top secret mission from Elder Fugen:<lf>Closing the village gates if the Rampage<lf>gets too close to Kamura!
<string>He said, and I quote: "The safety of Kamura<lf>is in your very hands!" He even had this proud<lf>twinkle in his eye.
<string>I have orders directly from Elder Fugen.<lf>My life as a top-secret agent begins!
<string>My mission is to shut that gate if any<lf>monsters come this way. So the fate<lf>of Kamura sorta rests on me, in a way.
<string>I mean, I get it—hunters have their<lf>work cut out for them. But this kind<lf>of responsibility's no cakewalk either.

<string>I mean, I get it—hunters have their<lf>work cut out for them. But this kind<lf>of responsibility's no cakewalk either.
<string>It's finally here! Boy, am I ready to get<lf>my fight on!
<string>...Buuut I can't.<lf>I have to be on standby as per<lf>Elder Fugen's secret orders.
<string>After all, if the Stronghold falls,<lf>it'll come down to me to protect<lf>the village.
<string>So, come at me, monsters!<lf>I'll just slam this gate shut<lf>right in your ugly faces!
<string>I was all ready to close the gate, but<lf>I guess it wasn't my time. Oh well,<lf>as long as everyone's safe, I guess.
<string>Um, soooo...you ran into a bloodthirsty<lf>monster called Magnamalo, right?
<string>Oh man. If that thing comes at us—<lf>Well, I mean, I'll close the gates,<lf>since that IS my mission, but...
<string>I was expecting to fend off something<lf>slightly, uh...less terrifying. Y'know,<lf>like some Baggis, or a Khezu maybe.
<string>Y-You're heading out to hunt Magnamalo?
<string>Don't mess this up, <PL>!<lf>If you do, I'll have to initiate "Operation:<lf>Close the Gate."
<string>And honestly, Magnamalo scares me;<lf>I thought the worst we'd encounter<lf>would be like some Bombadgy...
<string>Wow! Executed your Magnamalo<lf>mission with precision!
<string>I was afraid it might head this way, so,<lf>as a precautionary measure, I swallowed<lf>my fear and stayed right by the gates.
<string>Although, in spite of that achievement,<lf>the thought of facing a huge beast<lf>like that was fairly nerve-racking.
<string>So, if you HAVE to let a few monsters<lf>slip past you, could you limit them to<lf>the more manageable variety? Thanks!
<string>Even with Magnamalo gone, the Rampage<lf>hasn't stopped, meaning Kamura is still<lf>on high alert.
<string>And so am I! I'm ready to close the gate<lf>at any time. You can sleep safe and sound<lf>with me on guard!
<string>Oh. My. Gog! So, Guild Master Hojo<lf>passed by here a short while ago, and...
<string>He said, "Keep doing what you're doing."<lf>To think, I've earned the respect of our<lf>eldest and most venerable villager!
<string>That seriously pumps me up!<lf>Now I'm ready to take on any threat<lf>to the village's security! Hahaha!
<string><PL>, how goes the hunts?
<string>I'm still on that "close the gates in<lf>an emergency" mission, so my mind<lf>and body are constantly on edge.
<string>I'd say it's probably a lot like the<lf>apprehension you feel going head-<lf>to-head with a dangerous monster.
<string>So believe me when I say I understand<lf>how it is out there. I get you, Hunter.
<string><PL>, how goes the hunts?

<string>So believe me when I say I understand<lf>how it is out there. I get you, Hunter.
<string>A crazy big Rampage horde is close by.<lf>Apparently, it might even hit Kamura.
<string>But hey, if that happens, I'll be there<lf>to slam those gates shut. Don't you<lf>worry about that!
<string>Someone said a "serpent" showed up.<lf>Like, one that even Master Hojo hasn't<lf>seen before.
<string>If a flying monster comes our way,<lf>shutting the gates won't do much<lf>to stop it.
<string>Hence all the monster-repelling smoke we<lf>have blowing from the chimneys. Who<lf>knows if it works on serpents, though...
<string>If you were to let some monsters through,<lf>I'd really appreciate it if they weren't the<lf>serpent...or dangerous kind.
<string>After hearing that Minoto's feeling<lf>all guilty and glum about Hinoa,<lf>I went to go see her for myself.
<string>Sure enough, she's all mopey,<lf>so I pinched her cheek and told her:
<string>"Who could've known she'd resonate<lf>with a serpent? No one. So tell me,<lf>how could it possibly be your fault?"
<string>I'm just saying, if she really wants to<lf>shoulder some of this responsibility,<lf>go after the blue monster or something.
<string>No matter how much she cares for<lf>her sister, wallowing in self-blame<lf>isn't going to help either of them.
<string>The Rampage is finished if we<lf>do something about Ibushi?
<string>Well, it'd be a bummer to never see my<lf>mission through, but if it means peace<lf>returns to Kamura, I can live with that.
<string>Oh, Ibushi's turned up already?<lf>That was...fast.
<string>I'll be on standby to shut the gates,<lf>should the time to do so come. Can't<lf>let Elder Fugen down, after all.
<string>A closed gate probably wouldn't do<lf>much against Ibushi, though. So hey,<lf>don't let it come down to that, please?
<string>The Rampage STILL isn't over yet,<lf>so that means my mission is still a go.<lf>Heh, I say bring it on!
<string>I'm ready to close those gates<lf>at a split-second's notice.
<string>Now Minoto's the one resonating!<lf>Gosh, what is up with those twins?
<string>But she does seem happy to have<lf>the same ability as her sister,<lf>so there's that.
<string><PL>! While you were<lf>dragging your feet, a bunch of<lf>hunters went ahead to get Narwa!
<string>...Only to get one heck of a beatdown!<lf>Ugh, this all would've been over by now<lf>if you'd been there to help them!
<string>Come on, go give that thing a thrashing<lf>and show it that Kamura hunters aren't<lf>all a bunch of pushovers!
<string>Hinoa and Minoto resonating at the same<lf>time was unexpected. But they're really<lf>cool about it—maybe even used to it now.
<string>But with two serpents still around,<lf>I guess the Rampage, as well as<lf>my mission, are still on.
<string>Heh, I welcome the challenge. I'll see<lf>my mission through to the very end!

<string>Heh, I welcome the challenge. I'll see<lf>my mission through to the very end!
<string>Off to teach those serpents a lesson?<lf>Well, don't you worry about the village.
<string>Remember that mission of mine, to close<lf>the gates if the Rampage comes around?<lf>I intend to see it through to very the end.
<string>You and I are gonna protect Kamura with<lf>everything we've got. So hey, good luck<lf>to the both of us, huh?
<string>You know, I thought my mission would<lf>be over, what with the Rampage going<lf>away and all.
<string>But Elder Fugen says not yet because, quote:<lf>"Kamura may still be under threat from any<lf>of the remaining hordes nearby."
<string>I mean, I guess he's right, and I AM known to<lf>be a super dependable person...
<string>Which means I can't let someone who's put<lf>their trust in me down like that. And so, my<lf>mission to defend the village continues!
<string>My brother makes the umbrellas I sell.<lf>He stays home and does nothing but craft<lf>them. He's probably making one right now.
<string>He's kinda like Master Hamon.<lf>You know, the artist-type: difficult<lf>but nice once you get to know them.
<string>His umbrellas sell well enough in<lf>other towns, but I try to shift as<lf>much extra stock as I can for him.
<string>I guess hunters like you don't have much<lf>use for an umbrella out there, since they<lf>might get in the way and all.
<string>Still, if you want the perfect tool<lf>to protect you from the elements,<lf>then look no further!
<string>Kagero the Merchant comes by<lf>every once in a while to have<lf>that umbrella of his fixed up.
<string>Did you know it's made from Aknosom<lf>materials? Specifically that comb-like<lf>part they have on top of their heads.
<string>I wonder where he could've bought it?<lf>There's no way he made it himself.
<string>The rice merchants, Senari and<lf>Suzukari, are such a sweet couple,<lf>always supporting each other.
<string>They never fight, unlike my brother<lf>and I. Business aside, we're forever<lf>at each other's throats at home.
<string>But at the end of the day, I guess<lf>we do love each other.
<string>OK, that was kinda corny.<lf>Don't tell him I said that.
<string>My customer flow has practically evaporated<lf>thanks to this stupid Rampage.
<string>This bridge is how visitors enter the<lf>village, so I've always had no shortage<lf>of prospective buyers. Whereas now...
<string>*sigh* I suppose I shouldn't grumble,<lf>especially when everyone's just doing<lf>their best to get through this.
<string>We still have inventory headed outbound<lf>from the docks, so we're surviving. At<lf>least the Rampage hasn't affected that.
<string>I'm tasked with closing the gates if<lf>any threats get too close, but that<lf>hasn't happened yet. Like, at all.
<string>Sooo... I had this urge to close it,<lf>you know? And I decided I'd do it<lf>at night, when no one's watching.
<string>And boy, did it make a huuuge sound<lf>when it closed! Everyone panicked,<lf>and I got yelled at something fierce.
<string>I did point out that I need to practice<lf>sometime to be ready for the real thing,<lf>and that got me off the hook, luckily.
<string>But hey, it felt pretty good to<lf>actually shut the freakin' thing<lf>for once, so I have no regrets!
<string>So, my little brother was<lf>acting all sulky, and...
<string><NPC:28>Oh, I know.<lf>Boys just do that sometimes,<lf>don't they?
<string><NPC:26>Yeah. It's a real pain in the Astalos...
<string>...And the sales just aren't happening<lf>these days for some reason.
<string><NPC:28>Ugh, I know what you mean.<lf>Business is never easy, is it?
<string><NPC:26>Right! I really gotta do better...
<string>Just who I wanted to see!
<string>My brother's been brainstorming<lf>a new umbrella design that's<lf>sturdy yet fashionable.
<string>I'm sure it'll be a hit once he gets<lf>things in motion...
<string>Only thing is, he doesn't have enough materials<lf>to make a full inventory. And it's too dangerous<lf>for us to go out and gather them ourselves.
<string>Do you think you could help us out?<lf>I'll pay you back once they start sellin'!<lf>Pleeeeeeeease?
<string>Alright! Great work!
<string>Hey, thank you! These are exactly what<lf>we needed. BUT... There's a teeny tiny<lf>problem. Well, it's actually a big problem!
<string>We had the prototype looked over by<lf>one of our vendors and they said it's<lf>too heavy to use as an umbrella!
<string>So, y'know... Mass-production's on hold,<lf>and these'll be going towards redesign.
<string>But hey, I heard Master Hamon and Nakago<lf>created a new weapon based on our prototype.<lf>Didn't realize it was THAT heavy...
<string>Anyway, you should check it out! And, uh,<lf>can we call that your reward instead? *ahem*
