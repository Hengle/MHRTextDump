<string>Our village is famed for its Bunny<lf>Dango. I actually asked Hobashira<lf>the Sailor to help export them.
<string>I spend so much time in the kitchen,<lf>coming up with new recipes...
<string>I don't have much time to think about<lf>expanding. But I want the world to know<lf>about our delicious Bunny Dango!
<string>Our dango have already touched<lf>the hearts and stomachs of many,<lf>but why stop here?
<string>Once I'm finished up here, Yomogi and I<lf>are gonna work on some recipes. Top-notch<lf>dango aren't built in a day, y'know!
<string>Welcome, <PL>!<lf>If yer lookin' for grub at the Hub,<lf>then you're lookin' for me, Otemai.
<string>My Canteen's got the same menu<lf>as the Tea Shop, so you don't have<lf>to leave the Hub to eat.
<string>As a matter of fact, I'm the one<lf>who taught our darling Yomogi<lf>the "Way of the Dango."
<string>So you know both shops are fur-st<lf>class! Make it a habit to eat before<lf>you go meow-t on a hunt.
<string>Welcome, <PL>!<lf>If yer lookin' fur grub at the Hub,<lf>then you're lookin' for me, Otemai.
<string>My Canteen's got the same menu<lf>as the Tea Shop, so you don't have<lf>to leave the Hub to eat.
<string>As a matter of fact, I'm the one<lf>who taught our darling Yomogi<lf>the "Way of the Dango."
<string>So you know both shops are fur-st<lf>class! Make it a habit to eat before<lf>you go meow-t on a hunt.
<string>Yomogi and yours truly are responsible<lf>for coming up with Kamura's Bunny<lf>Dango. That's right!
<string>And after I taught her the "Way of the<lf>Dango," she's taken that knowledge<lf>and soared to new heights!
<string>She works real hard to come up<lf>with new and mew-nique flavors.<lf>I'm so purr-oud of her!
<string>My paws get all tangled trying to<lf>keep up, but as the meowster of<lf>dango, I won't be outdone!
<string>Welcome, <PL>!<lf>A dango a day keeps the meownsters away!
<string>My dango'll keep ya fur-esh!<lf>I use only Senari's finest rice<lf>and Wakana's greenest greens!
<string>My dango's deliciousness is down<lf>to how they're packed with the<lf>best blessings of the village!
<string>So, go on! Eat up!
<string>A giant Rampage is apurr-oaching,<lf>hm? In times like these, there's only<lf>one thing to do: Eat dango!
<string>Sure, they're mew-tritious, but more<lf>importantly, they're filled with care!
<string>Nothing gets you purr-pared for<lf>a hunt like our Bunny Dango!
<string>...Oh, <PL>.<lf>I was just lost in thought.
<string>Minoto's been down in the dumps ever since<lf>Hinoa had her incident with that meownster.<lf>She's just not the same anymore...
<string>You gotta take down that irritating<lf>meownster! Not only for our Hinoa,<lf>but for our purr-ecious Minoto too!
<string>I purr-pared some special Bunny<lf>Dango for Hinoa and Minoto.
<string>A real Otemai special that's sure to<lf>put some pep back in their steps!
<string>After all, look at how well Hinoa seems—<lf>it's because she eats plenty of dango.
<string>So, if I give them each a set,<lf>Hinoa'll make sure Minoto<lf>eats her respective portion too.
<string>And the two of them will be revitalized<lf>with dango-granted energy! It's<lf>fool-purr-oof, if I do say so myself.
<string>I heard they figured meow-t what causes<lf>the Rampage.
<string>The meownsters are fur-rightened,<lf>so they're hightailin' it to get<lf>away from Ibushi, right?
<string>Makes me so mad! Messin' with Hinoa,<lf>causing so many purr-oblems! I hope<lf>you whack that meownster good!
<string>Off to hunt Ibushi? Good!<lf>It's about time, <PL>!
<string>I'll do whatever I can too.<lf>For Hinoa, and Minoto, and<lf>everyone in the village.
<string>OK, I've gotta get these paws to work!<lf>Gotta make the dango!
<string>Pawesome work, <PL>!<lf>You deserve some delicious Bunny Dango!
<string>Did ya get that Ibushi good?<lf>Meow Hinoa and Minoto can rest easy!
<string>The Rampage might not be over, but<lf>if the twins are back to normal—well,<lf>that's a success in my books!
<string>Meow, I would say that a job well done<lf>deserves some delicious Bunny Dango,<lf>wouldn't you say?
<string>Hinoa's back to her normal and hungry self,<lf>but meow Minoto is acting all weird. Maido<lf>said her behavior's been kinda fur-eaky...
<string>Say what? Meow Minoto is resonating with<lf>a meownster!? Those two just can't catch<lf>a break, can they? Poor dears...
<string>But that's pawfuly weird. Minoto doesn't<lf>seem like she's in any pain at all...
<string>Maybe she's just trying to grin and bear<lf>for her sister's sake...
<string>It's time, isn't it? Are you purr-pared?<lf>Did you get enough to eat? OK,<lf>be careful meow-t there!
<string>And when you get back, we'll have a feast<lf>purr-pared fur you like you never seen before!<lf>A whole meow-ntain of Bunny Dango!
<string>We're all workin' our tails off to get it<lf>all ready, so make sure you're back in<lf>time for dinner!
<string>Well, if it isn't our hero, <PL>!<lf>Come meow, don't be shy!
<string>Kamura is safe because of you! We all<lf>owe you our gratitude.
<string>Anymew, off to hunt again today?<lf>Don't forget to fill your belly fur-st!
<string>Had your Bunny Dango yet? This is where<lf>they count fur real, y'know!
<string>And when you get back, we're all going<lf>to chow down on a delicious dango<lf>dinner! Leave the preparations to us!
<string>You really did it, <PL>!<lf>You stood fur-m, brought the Rampage<lf>to an end, and peace back to our village.
<string>Well, Savior of Kamura? What sorta hunt<lf>awaits you today? Hee hee!
<string>Our village is famed for its Bunny<lf>Dango. I actually asked Hobashira<lf>the Sailor to help export them.

<string>Once I'm finished up here, Yomogi and I<lf>are gonna work on some recipes. Top-notch<lf>dango aren't built in a day, y'know!
<string>Maido used to help out here, but they<lf>were desperately needin' a market here<lf>in the Hub, so I let her set up shop.
<string>She's reliable, never letting even a<lf>single dango go unaccounted for.<lf>I can trust her with the shop, fur sure.
<string>Her only flaw is that she's a meowssive<lf>blabbermouth, hehehe!
<string>Well, if hunters don't go to her fur<lf>goods they'll surely go to her fur<lf>the juicy gossip! Tehehehe!
<string>The cherry blossom trees are lovely, no?<lf>Hanamori has a passion for plants, which<lf>he graciously shares with me regularly.
<string>Surprised? Goes to show you really<lf>can't judge a book by its cover! If I've<lf>a purr-essing plant question, I ask him.
<string>He'll tell ya which plants need only<lf>a little water, and which ones are<lf>real thirsty. He knows his stuff.
<string>And you know what else is a shocker?<lf>He has quite the sweet tooth too. He<lf>even dips his dango in sugar!
<string>Have you seen the display of masks<lf>behind Hanamori? They're kinda<lf>funny looking, right?
<string>Honestly, I never thought those things<lf>would catch on until recently—I'd never<lf>seen anybody buy a single one.
<string>But then, the other day, I spotted Rondine<lf>purr-chasin' some. The next thing I knew,<lf>she was sellin 'em too!
<string>I mean, it's a well-made mask and all,<lf>but why would anyone want a meownster<lf>mask hanging on their wall?
<string>Oh, Rondine...<lf>I always thought you were a<lf>strange one; guess I was right.
<string>My work keeps me super busy.<lf>Hm? How busy? Meow let me think...
<string>Well, I make dango here, then review<lf>feedback, brainstorm new recipes with<lf>Yomogi...
<string>Make dango to be sent abroad,<lf>review feedback from Hobashira,<lf>try to impurr-ove the main recipe...
<string>Arrange for ingredients supplies from<lf>Senari, Suzukari, and Wakana—all,<lf>of course, with Yomogi and Hobashira.
<string>Then, I have to clean up. Gotta keep<lf>everything spick-and-span!
<string>Let's see, then—huh? What's that?<lf>You don't need me to describe my<lf>every detail? B-But that's not all of it!
<string>Tell me, <PL>, what<lf>kind of fur-lavor do you like? I'm<lf>fixin' to make a new dango recipe.
<string>Things can be sweet in many ways.<lf>You can tone it back and let the flavor<lf>shine through, or lay it on thick.
<string>You can add a touch of salt to bring<lf>out the sweetness, or make a sweet<lf>'n' sour dish with acidity!
<string>Then, there are benefits to making<lf>everything soft, but a firmer texture<lf>also has its own merits.
<string>Coming up with new combinations<lf>is super fun, but it sure does take<lf>a lot of effur-t!

<string>This one's gonna be a fur-lavorful treat!
<string>Wanna hear something wild? Apparently,<lf>there's a hunter out there who <COLS RED>dual-wields<lf>dango skewers as weapons</COL>!
<string>Being the dango meow-niac I am, there<lf>simply was no way I could furget about<lf>something like that.
<string>And that's why: I've modified our Bunny<lf>Dango to be usable as dual blades!
<string>They're just as tasty as ever, but eating<lf>them during a hunt is a big no-no! If you<lf>doze off, you might be monster lunch!
<string>I gave some of the materials to Meowster<lf>Hamon. If you're interested, why don'tcha<lf>go ask him about making you one?
<string>It's a true meowsterpiece—try it!
