<string>Ah, <PL>, it's you!<lf>Hope you're doin' well!
<string>Off to that Kingdom outpost, are ya?<lf>A research military base...that must be<lf>some operation they got goin' on there.
<string>A logistics nightmare if you ask me.<lf>Just to transport all the supplies<lf>would cost some serious zenny...
<string>And the supply docks must be massive...<lf>How would you even go about buildin'<lf>something like that?
<string>If you get a chance to check it out, let me<lf>know the details next time you're back<lf>in Kamura. I'll be looking forward to it.
<string>Hey, <PL>. Welcome back!<lf>Still in one piece?
<string>Oh, that reminds me! If there's anything<lf>you need, don't hesitate to ask.
<string>If it's something we have here in the<lf>village, I'll do my best to get it to you.
<string>I bet you'll find all kinds of new things durin'<lf>your adventures in the Kingdom. I wonder if<lf>they'd be interested in goods from Kamura...
<string>Master Hamon asked me to bring him<lf>any literature I can get my hands on<lf>about the Kingdom's forgin' tech.
<string>I heard their smithies use some pretty<lf>"interestin'" techniques, but I guess<lf>you already knew that, huh?
<string>You'd think that someone with the level<lf>of skill that Master Hamon has would<lf>slow down in his old age...
<string>But that man never stops goin'! That's<lf>why he's one of the greatest to ever do<lf>it. He has my respect, that's for sure!
<string>Just the other day, I received an official<lf>request from the Kingdom to deliver<lf>supplies to Elgado.
<string>Logistically it must be pretty difficult<lf>to send all the necessary supplies to<lf>the Outpost from their distributors.
<string>Of course, there's a limit to what we<lf>can move. But every little bit helps,<lf>and I'm more than happy to help.
<string>The Kingdom's ships are pretty distinct<lf>from ships from other regions in terms of<lf>size and function. Magnificent vessels...
<string>Even their trading ships are a sight<lf>to behold. Their military ships must<lf>be even more advanced.
<string>What I wouldn't give to take a<lf>ride on one someday.
<string>The other day I heard a merchant from<lf>the Kingdom get off his ship and say,<lf>"So this is THE Kamura Village?"
<string>I couldn't believe he had heard of us,<lf>so I asked him how he knew about<lf>Kamura.
<string>And he said, "everyone knows Kamura<lf>is where the amazing '<PL>,<lf>the Fierce' is from!"
<string>I can't believe that people all the way<lf>over in the Kingdom have heard of you!<lf>Truly amazin'!
<string>I'm sure Maido will find some way to profit<lf>off your newfound fame. She might even<lf>give you a cut if you're lucky. Haha!
