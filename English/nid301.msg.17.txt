<string><NOFAC>Well, well, <PL>.<lf>You're a hunter now. Well done.
<string>I am Kogarashi.<lf>I have been charged as the Chief of<lf>Felyne Affairs within Kamura Village.
<string>Years prior, I served as Elder Fugen's<lf>Palico, and we undertook many a hunt.<lf>Now, I command the Meowcenaries.
<string>If you are ever curious about the<lf>Meowcenaries, feel free to ask me<lf>about them any time.
<string>May our alliance endure the ages.
<string>Watching you, <PL>,<lf>I am reminded of the first time I went<lf>out on the hunt under Fugen.
<string>At that time, I was still weak,<lf>yet full of hot-blooded indignation,<lf>earning many a reproach from him.
<string>*chuckle* Compared to how I was,<lf>you're a model hunter, <PL>!
<string>I feel a breeze I've known before...
<string>...It was fifty years ago. It seems an<lf>unseemly foe gradually encroaches<lf>upon the village once more.
<string>...<PL>. I, too, shall<lf>defend the village at the Stronghold.<lf>May our spirits temper each other.
<string>Magnamalo...<lf>Its odious form is yet burnt in my mind.
<string>Fitting would it be for it to fall by<lf>my hand... Alas, Fugen has entrusted<lf>this task to you, <PL>.
<string>If that is what Elder Fugen desires,<lf>then I must abide by his wishes.
<string>Hamon always had a potent combination of<lf>creativity and an ability to realize it.
<string>Fugen, Hojo, and, of course, myself<lf>owe much to Hamon and his ingenuity.
<string>Hamon has done it again with his latest<lf>contraption. It is marvelous!
<string>So, <PL>, you needn't fear;<lf>only to have faith in yourself<lf>and confront Magnamalo.
<string><PL>, a<lf>marvelous job on your hunt.
<string>You've put to rest our chagrin<lf>of half a century. Words cannot<lf>express my thanks.
<string><PL>, are you<lf>going to the Gathering Hub?
<string>Hub quests can be challenged<lf>in the company of allies.
<string>Whilst I served as Fugen's Palico, I,<lf>alongside Fugen, Hamon, and Hojo,<lf>undertook many a hunt together.
<string>*chuckle* Those were quite the times...
<string>I was but a clumsy kitten when<lf>Fugen first took me out into<lf>the field.
<string>When he retired and took up the position<lf>of Village Elder, Fugen imparted unto me<lf>the role of "Chief of Felyne Affairs."
<string>It was to my utmost delight.<lf>Fugen has done more for me<lf>than I could repay in a lifetime.
<string><PL>, have you been<lf>remembering to eat your Bunny<lf>Dango before the hunt?
<string>Fugen has been a dango glutton ever<lf>since he was a hunter. He would stuff<lf>them down his gullet like no other.
<string>*chuckle* Those were quite the times...
<string>... <PL>,<lf>the approaching Rampage horde is<lf>commanded by an Apex Arzuros.
<string>As it is an Apex, you will not defeat<lf>it using ordinary tactics.
<string>But Hojo believes in you, <PL>,<lf>so you shall surely prevail.<lf>Fight with confidence.
<string>As Hinoa resonates with the serpent,<lf>her body is assailed. It causes Fugen<lf>great distress to see her suffer, too.
<string>We need to figure out what this azure<lf>beast is—we've not a moment to waste.
<string>I am collaborating with Master Utsushi<lf>and his team to identify this serpent;<lf>we've yet to prove successful, however.
<string>The more we investigate,<lf>the more I feel it is worlds apart<lf>from any ordinary monster.
<string>Judging by Hinoa's resonance,<lf>it is clear that this beast possesses<lf>dire otherworldly power...
<string>The cause of the Rampage has<lf>finally been unearthed.
<string>Wind Serpent Ibushi...<lf>That monster is responsible for enraging<lf>beasts and sowing the seeds of calamity.
<string><PL>.<lf>Now is the time to fell the beast,<lf>for the sake of Kamura Village.
<string><PL>.<lf>Wind Serpent Ibushi has<lf>finally shown itself...
<string>I have seen it my very own eyes,<lf>clear as the stars are bright.
<string>Fugen, Hojo, and Hamon—nay,<lf>every villager places their<lf>faith in you, <PL>.
<string>It's in your hands now.
<string>We lost track of Ibushi<lf>some distance from here.
<string>We are continuing to look into its<lf>whereabouts, but for the time being at<lf>least, the threat has been dispersed.
<string>Even so, traces of the Rampage<lf>are still abound... <PL>,<lf>keep your guard up for now.
<string>Presently, we are investigating<lf>Thunder Serpent Narwa.
<string>We're sure to snag its tail soon.<lf>It is only a matter of time.
<string>...<PL>.
<string>Take down Narwa and bring the<lf>calamitous Rampage that has plagued<lf>Kamura to an end, once and for all.
<string>We are all praying for<lf>your success, <PL>.<lf>...Good luck.
<string>Ibushi and Narwa both yet draw breath.
<string>My investigation continues.<lf>Should I find anything, I will be<lf>sure to inform you post-haste.
<string>And in that event... I shall<lf>leave it in your capable hands.
<string>Seeing you out there has<lf>reinvigorated me to rejoin the hunt<lf>myself, <PL>.
<string>I could invite Fugen, just the once;<lf>and I suppose it would do<lf>to ask Hojo and Hamon, too...
<string>*chuckle*<lf>The villagers would be furious with us,<lf>cavorting about like that at our ages.
<string>At last, we have ascertained the<lf>whereabouts of Ibushi and Narwa.
<string>It would have been ideal to have found them<lf>before they had the chance to reunite...<lf>But we cannot turn back the clock.
<string>We have no choice but to leave<lf>everything to you now, <PL>.<lf>Kamura is counting on you.
<string>...<PL>.<lf>I cannot express my thanks enough.
<string>You have slain the two elder dragons and<lf>saved Kamura from calamity... Your deeds<lf>are truly those of a hero.
<string>But now is no time to idle! You must<lf>continue honing your skills—after all,<lf>a hunter's work is never done.
<string>...<PL>. Seeing how your<lf>skills continue to develop warms<lf>my Felyne heart.
<string>But now is no time to idle! You must<lf>continue honing your skills—after all,<lf>a hunter's work is never done.
<string>Watching you, <PL>,<lf>I am reminded of the first time I went<lf>out on the hunt under Fugen.
<string>At that time, I was still weak,<lf>yet full of hot-blooded indignation,<lf>earning many a reproach from him.
<string>*chuckle* Compared to how I was,<lf>you're a model hunter, <PL>!
<string>I once hunted alongside Fugen, Hojo,<lf>and Hamon, as comrades in arms.
<string>I was the youngest of the bunch,<lf>but I fought through thick and thin<lf>with them all nonetheless.
<string>I'd sooner trade my right paw<lf>than give up those memories.
<string>Fugen's weapon mastery...<lf>It was truly a thing to behold.
<string>Just when you thought you glimpsed the<lf>flash of a sword, the opposing monsters<lf>would be face-down in the dirt.
<string>You want to know how Hojo hunted<lf>back in the day? I never know how<lf>to approach explaining it, but...
<string>I suppose one could say<lf>it was rather, well...<lf>awe-inspiring.
<string>I remember it to have been<lf>very "Tetsucabra-esque."
<string>Both how he looked and how<lf>he hunted, that is. There's<lf>no other way to describe it.
<string>Hamon has always been strict. He'd scold<lf>me if I was ill-prepared for a hunt, or<lf>if I let my emotions get the best of me.
<string>But Hamon applies his stringency<lf>to none more seriously than himself.
<string>That is why he was as much<lf>an excellent hunter as he is<lf>a blacksmith today.
<string>The Rampage is a calamity without peer,<lf>yet through everyone standing together<lf>in unity, we have prevailed over it.
<string>Above all else, I am impressed by how<lf>valiantly our young hunters fought—<lf>Kamura's future looks bright indeed.
<string>But, it was another joy to discover<lf>that us old timers haven't lost our<lf>edge either.
<string>Fugen, Hojo, and Hamon still have in them<lf>that same fire from before... And I suppose<lf>you could say that I do as well.
<string>*chuckle* Each and every citizen<lf>of Kamura is full of vim and<lf>vigor now. That is promising.

<string><NOFAC>...<PL>, I've quite the<lf>important task for you.
<string>It has taken a great deal of effort to<lf>organize, but now the <COLS RED>Meowcenaries</COL><lf>are finally ready for action.
<string>Meowcenaries ride special Buddy-sized<lf>kites high in the air, surveying the land<lf>to identify encroaching danger.
<string>And thus we arrive at my request. The Buddies<lf>at your side have grown quite strong... I ask that<lf>they join the Meowceneries' efforts.
<string>Kamura Points will be needed to maintain<lf>the kites, but any materials your Buddies find<lf>out on reconnaissance are yours to keep.
<string>So? What do you say? It would help<lf>to ensure the safety of the village,<lf>if you have no qualms with it.

<string><NOFAC>...<PL>, I've quite the<lf>special task fur you.
<string>Recently, the Meowcenaries identified<lf>some <COLS RED>Rampage activity</COL> in the vicinity<lf>of a presently active low-rank quest.
<string>As Meowcenaries, we cannot ignore this.<lf>We have sighted a Rampage threat, and<lf>I ask that you allow us to deal with it.
<string>If your Buddies are successful,<lf>more materials will be rewarded<lf>to you.
<string>The time has come.
<string><NOFAC>Greetings, <PL>. I have good news.<lf>The Meowcenaries have ascended<lf>to a new level of greatness.
<string>They can be dispatched to high rank<lf>quest regions, where more dangerous<lf>monsters reside.
<string>I have utter confidence in your Buddies'<lf>capabilities, even in more hazardous lands,<lf>so do not hesitate to send them out.
<string>The Meowcenaries are ready.
<string>...<PL>, we have<lf>a situation I need to bring to<lf>your attention.
<string>Rumors speak of a drastic increase in high<lf>rank monsters. This can only mean one<lf>thing... The resurgence of the Rampage.
<string>Should our scouts spot any such activity,<lf>I ask that you dispatch the Meowcenaries<lf>to deal with it.
<string>I have utter confidence in your Buddies'<lf>capabilities, so do not worry or hesitate<lf>to send them out.
<string><NOFAC>Come to see about the Meowcenaries,<lf>have you, <PL>?
<string>I'm afraid they're still readying themselves<lf>at present. But don't worry, I'll send<lf>word to you later when they're done.
