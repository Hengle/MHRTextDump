<string>Ah, an honor to meet you.<lf>I am Chino.
<string>We have come to Kamew-ra Village in<lf>hopes of trading with the respectable<lf>people here.
<string>That said, we are merely assistants to<lf>our Lady Rondine.
<string>Fur any details, we implore that you<lf>direct them to our dear Lady.
<string>Now, this is most wonderful.<lf>Unlike our home, Kamew-ra Village has<lf>so much nature abound. 'Tis refur-eshing.
<string>By the way, I hear that this village<lf>is renowned for its steel.
<string>Do you know anyone who might be<lf>able to tell us about it? We would<lf>love to learn more.
<string>I've taken a look at the steel<lf>purr-oduced in Kamew-ra, and<lf>I will say that it is indeed beautiful.
<string>I have traveled to many places alongside<lf>our dear Lady, but I have never seen<lf>such quality steel before.
<string>What we would not give to get<lf>our paws on that tech...
<string>To...uh, trade, of course.<lf>We are but simple traders after all.
<string>The Rampage: a calamity in<lf>meownstrous physical form...
<string>The steelmaking process of this village<lf>must have been created and refined to<lf>counter such a threat.
<string>If only we too had such techniques,<lf>our kingdom might also be purr-otected—
<string>B-But...what do we know about that?<lf>We are but simple traders after all.

<string>B-But...what do we know about that?<lf>We are but simple traders after all.
<string>As I understand, the steel purr-oduction in<lf>Kamew-ra seems to be mostly dependent on<lf>Sir Hamon the Blacksmith.
<string>He looked like his paws were full with<lf>the Apex-led Rampage, so I'm going to<lf>see if we can talk to him later.
<string>And if we can purr-suade him to join our—
<string>Uh...<lf>Purr-suade him to trade with us!<lf>We are but simple traders after all.
<string>Since Sir Hamon is the epicenter<lf>of Kamew-ra's superior steelworking...
<string>Naturally, I went to go chat with him.
<string>But that cold, piercing stare...
<string>I consider myself a capable Palico,<lf>but when I saw him, I fur-oze up...<lf>Couldn't say a word.
<string>Purrr, I'm shaken to my core.<lf>Is he...truly but a mere blacksmith?

<string>Purrr, I'm shaken to my core.<lf>Is he...truly but a mere blacksmith?
<string>I am currently conducting daily<lf>observations of Sir Hamon from afar,<lf>to learn more about Kamew-ra steelmaking.
<string>That sharp gaze he gives his creations,<lf>the seasoned skill in molding material—<lf>I sense an unwavering ethos fur-om it...
<string>Sir Hamon must truly love it all:<lf>His weapons, armor, the hunters,<lf>and most of all this very village.
<string>...How odd.
<string>I... I'm sure I've felt this before.<lf>What could this throbbing feeling<lf>in my chest be?
<string>I am touched by Sir Hamon's way of<lf>connecting with his creations, fur-om<lf>the bottom of my heart.
<string>I hear that Sir Hamon will be headed<lf>to the Stronghold as a defender against<lf>the Rampage.
<string>Dearest Sir Hamon...<lf>I shall purr-ay for your safe return.
<string>I shall be honest... I gave Sir Hamon<lf>a few good luck charms before he went<lf>to the Stronghold.
<string>And when he returned, he came here<lf>to talk to me.
<string>He said, "The items you gave me<lf>saved me many times. Thank you."
<string>His words sent chills down my tail.<lf>What a courteous man he is!
<string>So if that dragon Narwa is defeated,<lf>the Rampage will end?
<string>Yet the expression on Sir Hamon's face<lf>is as hard and stoic as ever.
<string>I can only hope that the day when<lf>Sir Hamon may spend his life in<lf>peace arrives soon.
<string>"The people of Kamew-ra are family.<lf>We are one."
<string>Oh, such strong and yet tender words<lf>spoken by Sir Hamon! They utterly<lf>reduced me to tears.
<string>Dear Hunter, believe in Sir Hamon's<lf>words and you will surely succeed<lf>in your hunt.
<string>Lady Rondine must have already<lf>told you that we are not actually<lf>traders...
<string>We came to Kamew-ra Village with the<lf>aim of convincing Sir Hamon to serve our<lf>kingdom with his steelworking skills.
<string>However, I couldn't keep lying to<lf>Sir Hamon any longer, and told him<lf>the truth.
<string>I thought he would despise me, but<lf>he simply thanked me fur telling him,<lf>and treated me some Bunny Dango.
<string>Those dango were so tasty.<lf>Even if they were a little salty<lf>from the tears...
<string>Sir Hamon has been coming<lf>by a lot recently.
<string>He said he wanted to see my drawings<lf>for inspiration...
<string>I am truly a happy Felyne...<lf>Nothing compares to the time<lf>I have spent beside Sir Hamon.
<string>I hear that you meow know where<lf>Ibushi and Narwa have been hiding...
<string>In defeating those two serpents, this<lf>village will be free from the Rampage...<lf>and Sir Hamon's greatest wish fulfilled.
<string>Dear Hunter, please, take them down—<lf>so that both Sir Hamon and Kamew-ra<lf>Village may live in peace.
<string>You've done it! You've freed Kamew-ra from<lf>the terror of the Rampage! An act truly<lf>fitting for a champion among knights!
<string>I still remember that feast we had on<lf>the day of your return. I had a couple<lf>of sips of alcohol beside Sir Hamon.
<string>It was there that I observed his expression:<lf>it was one of joy, with but the faintest of<lf>glints in his eye... I shall never forget it!
<string>Drawing things is a hobby of mine.<lf>But I am a novice, so I'm rather<lf>self-conscious about it.
<string>But Lady Rondine said the best way<lf>of getting better is to have diffur-ent<lf>people take a look at my art.
<string>I've placed a few of my drawings in<lf>the trading area. Please note that<lf>they're not fur sale.
<string>I enjoy drawing things. Whenever I see<lf>something in my travels that stands out,<lf>I honor it with paw, brush, and canvas.
<string>Though, admittedly, that takes some of<lf>the attention away fur-om my work.
<string>So I must be extra vigilant, lest<lf>I be scolded by Lady Rondine.
<string>I hear there is a talented artist in<lf>the Gathering Hub. How I would<lf>love to have a chat with that person.
<string>A different culture often leads to<lf>different art. It would be wonderful<lf>to learn of Kamew-ra aesthetics.
<string>I went to the Hub to meet and<lf>speak with the talented artist,<lf>Guild Meowster Hojo.
<string>Sir Hojo is indeed amazing. He is able<lf>to capture a meownster's essence, and<lf>yet his touch makes it comical...
<string>Now Miss Minoto's work...<lf>She mentioned it was nothing special,<lf>but I beg diffur.
<string>It may have been rough around the edges,<lf>but in it I saw a genius touch that may<lf>stand alongside Sir Hojo's one day.
<string>And yet, here I am critiquing<lf>such talent when I am but<lf>a mere novice...
<string>There are so many things in Kamew-ra<lf>that I would like to draw.
<string>Especially the people of this village.<lf>They are always so full of energy,<lf>even in the face of calamity.
<string>And whenever I draw their faces,<lf>I can feel that energy within me.
<string>I have been taking drawing lessons<lf>recently from Sir Hojo and Miss Hinoa.
<string>That carefree stroke of the brush,<lf>the vivid use of color... My wish<lf>is to make those skills my own.
<string>But that tasty scent of Bunny<lf>Dango wafting through the<lf>Hub makes it so hard to focus!
