<string>Got a favor, Scrawny!
<string>This is just between you and me, but I've<lf>taken a request to capture a Tigrex and<lf>I was thinkin' maybe I'll just give it to you...
<string>I'd love to go out there and smack the<lf>stripes off it, but these dango here are<lf>just too good. I can't stop eatin' 'em!
<string>I'll make it worth your while. There's a bowgun<lf>called the Felyne Cannon. I can teach ya how<lf>to make that kitty purr! Sound good?
<string>Now don't mess around out there or you're<lf>gonna get wrecked! I'm talkin' train wrecked!<lf>I'm talkin' e— Hey! Where ya goin'? Gwahaha!
<string>Not bad, Scrawny. Not bad.
<string>So I heard you caught that Tiggy. I probably<lf>coulda done it faster, but whatever.<lf>Anyway, thanks for lookin' out.
<string>I already let that pretty redhead over at<lf>the Smithy know how to upgrade your fire-<lf>spittin' kitty cat. Go see her about it!
<string>Now if you don't mind, I gotta get back<lf>to keepin' Elgado safe. But first, more<lf>dango! Gwahaha!
<string>Huh? Never seen your wimpy mug 'round<lf>these parts before.
<string>You dare stand before the rawest, the<lf>roughest, the Red Hell Hunter!? Well,<lf>lemme give you some advice, Scrawny!
<string>These dango, OK? They're the best thing<lf>you've ever tasted in your pathetic life!<lf>THE BEST, you hear me, wimp!?
<string>Since I started eatin' these things, I've<lf>been accepting quests JUST to get<lf>my next fix! Gwahaha!
<string>Hmph. I've heard the talk. Sounds like<lf>you've actually done a little hunting.<lf>Well, who gives a Rath's— *ahem*
<string>Anyway, when you've actually hunted<lf>something bigger than a Bnahabra, let<lf>me know. Until then...
<string>I'll be over here downin' these dango.<lf>Watch and you might learn something<lf>about bein' a REAL hunter! Gwahaha!
<string>So you're runnin' home to your safe wittle<lf>playpen!? Ugh, that's the problem with<lf>you hunters today!
<string>A REAL hunter learns to hunt by slingin'<lf>back ale, goin' out in the field, and smackin'<lf>a few monsters around!
<string>Well, let us know when you get back<lf>from day care. Gwahahaha! 
<string>Going home to train, huh? What a bunch<lf>of Bullfango! You can't fool me! We all<lf>know why you're going back to Kamura. 
<string>They have these dango on tap over there!<lf>No wonder you can't wait to get back.<lf>Can't say I blame ya! Gwahaha!
<string>Gwahaha!<lf>Time to show you what a REAL hunter<lf>can do!
<string>First things first, food! Gotta fill the<lf>old furnace! Then we'll show you<lf>why they call us the Hell Hunters!
<string>You better be counting your lucky stars<lf>I got all these dango in front of me.<lf>Gwahaha!
<string>Any bit of fame and glory you were dreamin'<lf>of would be snatched right out from under<lf>ya by the mighty Hell Hunters!
<string>Heh, none of these trifles are worth our<lf>time. Maybe they're on your level, but<lf>I've slept through harder quests!
<string>If something comes along that you can't<lf>handle, you know where to come knocking.<lf>We're waitin' to save you! Gwahaha!
<string>Headin' out with the Order, huh?<lf>That's a good call from the Admiral!
<string>He knows this base will be fine with<lf>the Hell Hunters here to defend it!<lf>A keen mind, that one! Gwahaha!
<string>So what if the Three Lames are messin'<lf>with other monsters. That's what monsters<lf>do; the big ones pick on the little ones...
<string>Let me know when a real disaster shows<lf>up and maybe I'll put these dangos down<lf>long enough to care! Gwahahaha!
<string>Gwahaha! Some poor sap getting chased<lf>around by a monster, huh? Y'all never fail<lf>to put on a show while I eat!
<string>Well, if you manage to save their sorry<lf>carcass, bring 'em here and I'll treat 'em<lf>to a dango for not gettin' eaten.
<string>You sure took your sweet time! I lost count<lf>how many plates of these dango I put away<lf>while waiting for your sorry keister!
<string>What's the matter? Baby's havin' a tough<lf>time huntin' somewhere new? Boo hoo!<lf>Suck it up and eat your dango! Gwahaha!
<string>Well, look at you! Off to hunt one of<lf>those Three Lords, huh? Finally some<lf>REAL action!
<string>Well, I'd love to go out there with ya, but<lf>I gotta stay here and keep this outpost<lf>safe. Sorry, my hands are tied...
<string>Tied to these dango! Gwahahaha!<lf>See ya around, Scrawny!
<string>Well, I can't believe it. You actually lived?<lf>Gwahahaha!
<string>I don't know why everybody's worried<lf>about these Three Lames if YOU can<lf>take one of 'em down!
<string>Hmph. Well, keep it up! You concentrate<lf>on these pushover monsters and I'll<lf>concentrate on these dango! Gwahaha!
<string>More investigations!? Bah... That's your<lf>department. We didn't come all the way<lf>out here to do grunt work!
<string>Well, have fun with that. Me? Guess<lf>I'll just have to order me another plate!<lf>Gwahaha!
<string>Off to play fetch with that Lunagaron, eh?<lf>So, they got you puppysittin' now?<lf>What a sucker!
<string>Well, you do you. The whole drooling<lf>dog thing isn't really me. I'm more of<lf>a cat person.
<string>Hmph. So what you made it back in one<lf>piece, huh? Well, it wasn't because of<lf>your huntin' skills, I'll tell you that!
<string>Malzeno looked at your scrawny carcass<lf>and took pity on ya. Gwahaha!
<string>Quite the sharp eye, for a monster!<lf>I'm finally starting to get invested<lf>in all this!
<string>Hey. I heard that lady from the Order<lf>isn't feeling so good. Make your pathetic<lf>self useful and take her this dango!
<string>It can't hurt for her to get some proper<lf>nutrition inside her. Dango are the most<lf>important food group! Go on, I insist!
<string>With the Order down a knight, I guess<lf>we'll stay here and keep an eye on things.
<string>Not that I'd go out on any of those quests<lf>anyway! They're more pathetic than you,<lf>Scrawny! Gwahaha!
<string>Hey! What did I just hear? Are my ears<lf>deceiving me? Did you say "Malzeno!?"
<string>That's our mark, ya got that, Scrawny?<lf>We've been waitin' for something worthy<lf>of the mighty Hell Hunters!
<string>W-We just need to finish eatin' first. Them<lf>Felynes put a lotta love into these dango<lf>and I ain't about to let 'em go to waste!
<string>If I ever catch you skippin' out on these<lf>treats, I'm gonna clobber you right in<lf>that ugly melon of yours!
<string>Hmph. So you took down Malzeno, eh?<lf>Normally I wouldn't be impressed, and<lf>I'm not THAT impressed, but...
<string>You've proven yourself today, Scrawns.<lf>I can admit it. You don't look like much,<lf>but you can hunt.
<string>But it only happened 'cos you've been<lf>workin' so hard to catch up to us, right?<lf>It's like I trained you myself! Gwahaha!
<string>Hey. You still hanging out in Elgado?<lf>I know, I know. You want to see the<lf>Hell Hunters in action.
<string>I'd love to give you a REAL show,<lf>but we need a monster worth fightin'<lf>or it'll be over before it even starts.
<string>Sorry to disappoint. But think of it like<lf>this: If we hunted all the monsters,<lf>they wouldn't need you! Gwahaha!
<string>Ugh, those research dweebs are the worst!<lf>"wHy aRE tHe qUrIo gAtHeRInG?" WHO<lf>CARES! Monsters aren't complicated!
<string>All you need to know is: Have you smashed<lf>the monster? If "NO," then smash it!<lf>If "YES," smash it again! Gwahaha!
<string>Gwahaha! Now THAT'S a monster worth<lf>waitin' for! Just you wait, we're gonna<lf>put on a REAL show for ya!
<string>That is if it wasn't for one little thing...er,<lf>things. It's got all those icky— *ahem*<lf>little Qurio circling overhead, right?
<string>Elder dragon? Pftt. More like elderly dragon,<lf>am I right? That thing's gonna keel over any<lf>minute. It ain't worth our time!
<string>The thing's practically a goner already.<lf>That's why those Qurio are buzzin' around<lf>its carcass. If you want it, it's all yours!
<string>Serious talk, Scrawny. Even I have to admit<lf>you've got some skills. I'm a big man.
<string>But there's something keepin' you from<lf>bein' an elite hunter! And that's strength<lf>of the stomach!
<string>You might be a hunter, but ya need to<lf>eat like a monster to match me! Gwahaha!
<string>Get a load of Scrawny, here! You think I <lf>care what cute li'l bunny monsters you've<lf>hunted!? Pfft. Why would I?
<string>We're the Hell Hunters! We could rip<lf>a monster's tail off with our bare hands<lf>if it looked at us the wrong way!
<string>What's the deal with the old guy? He's<lf>always lookin' over here at me. Who is<lf>he? What does he want?
<string>Hmmm... Maybe he's a fan. You know<lf>you've made it when even the old folks<lf>know you're a legend! Gwahaha!
<string>So you put some hours in, did ya?<lf>I guess you've improved...
<string>But you still couldn't hunt your way<lf>out of a wet paper bag!
<string>Count the dango on this table, see?<lf>That's how far ahead of you my hunter<lf>rank is! Count them and weep!
<string>The Order seems to have taken a real<lf>shine to you. Huh! All well and good,<lf>but don't you forget something.
<string>You ain't from the Kingdom, and you<lf>ain't a knight either. There's no need<lf>for you to copy their ways.
<string>When the crud hits the Konchu you've<lf>only got your skills and wits to save you!<lf>That's how we do it! Gwahaha!
<string>OK, let's take a look... How's the crater<lf>today? Yep, same as yesterday—<lf>Big hole, full of water.
<string>Oh, you heard that, did ya? Just a little<lf>daily routine of mine. Nothing to get<lf>excited about.
<string>You know if anything pops out, they're all<lf>gonna come runnin' to me, so don't get<lf>your breeches in a twist. I got it! Gwahaha!
<string>I pity you. All that huntin', and you ain't<lf>got the slightest idea what REAL skill<lf>looks like. Wait till you see us in action!
<string>Don't get all sad about it! You might<lf>still get to!
<string>If you're staying in Elgado a little longer,<lf>you never know, a chance might pop up.<lf>Here's hoping, huh? Gwahaha!
<string>I'll take on anyone who wants to take<lf>a shot, but I won't go easy on ya! That's<lf>just proper etiquette! Gwahaha!
