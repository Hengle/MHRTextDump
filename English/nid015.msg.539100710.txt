<string>Meowdy!<lf>Chasin' after something?
<string>Meowdy, <PL>!
<string>Heading out? Me? I got my paws<lf>full with these deliveries!
<string>Meowdy, <PL>! So you're<lf>a hunter meow? Congratulations!
<string>Keep workin' hard so you can<lf>be the best hunter you can be!
<string>I'll do the same, but so I can<lf>carry these deliveries the best<lf>I can carry 'em!
<string>I'm up to my whiskers in deliveries!<lf>And they all gotta get to where<lf>they need to go!
<string>And when it's all done, I'm gonna<lf>treat myself to some Bunny Dango.<lf>You can bet your tail I'm excited!
<string>All deliveries, light or heavy,<lf>have to be handled with the<lf>utmost care and patience.
<string>It's come such a long way;<lf>it'd be a huge shame if something<lf>happened to it here...
<string>There's a trick to lifting heavy stuff:
<string>You crouch down low, like you're gonna<lf>pounce on something. Bring it real close,<lf>then lift with your tummy muscles!
<string>And if that doesn't work... Then you<lf>get Hobashira to do it for you!
<string>The Rampage? I mean, sure,<lf>it's purr-etty scary.
<string>But with you and everyone in Kamura<lf>on our side, I'm not worried!
<string>I'll just keep doing what I do best:<lf>carrying all the stuff from the docks.<lf>I bet that'll help out a ton, too!
<string><PL>!<lf>You're back! Not hurt, are you?
<string>Oh, that's a relief! Wanna go<lf>eat some dango together later?
<string>I'll let you in on a little secret:<lf>it's easier to carry stuff if you put<lf>the heaviest ones on the bottom!
<string>Hobashira taught me that.<lf>Cool, right!?
<string>Why is it easier? Um...I dunno.
<string>Good luck, <PL>,<lf>and stay safe out there!
<string>We'll be here to purr-otect the village,<lf>so don't you worry.
<string>Meowdy!
<string>The river's looking super sparkly<lf>today. Wanna come swimming<lf>with us later, <PL>?
<string>Meowdy, <PL>!<lf>Hard at work today too, huh?<lf>Then I'd better match your pace!
<string>I'll haul so fast, the shipments'll be<lf>gone in a fur-ash!
<string>What's up? The Hub isn't over here,<lf>if that's what you're looking for.
<string>Meowdy, <PL>!<lf>I know you're doing a lot for us.<lf>Know that we all ap-purr-eciate it!
<string>I don't really know much about hunting,<lf>but I do know that you're really strong<lf>and amazing. I can just feel it!
<string>"Heave! Meow! Meow! Ho!"
<string>I just came back fur-om eating dango,<lf>and the chefs' shouts are super catchy.
<string>I want to try it myself<lf>when I'm working.
<string>The Rampage's coming?<lf>Uh oh, we better get our tails in gear!
<string>I gotta get these deliveries delivered!<lf>No time to waste meow!
<string>Is it true that Hinoa's OK now?<lf>I was seriously worried 'bout her.
<string>Someday, I wanna be able to carry<lf>heavy goods without breaking a sweat.
<string><PL>?<lf>Think you could give me some<lf>training advice?
<string>I've actually been working out at<lf>the Buddy Plaza to get stronger.
<string>They say you need to "feel the burn!"<lf>Well, I'm feeling it. I'm sore all over.<lf>Even the tip of my tail...
<string>Training sure ain't easy!
<string>There's so much stuff to deliver,<lf>I'd love to get a couple more hands<lf>or paws. Wouldn't ask for yours, though.
<string>Why? Because your paws are better suited<lf>to other kinds of work. Like hunting!
<string>Are you OK, <PL>?<lf>Anything hurting?
<string>We can't thank you enough!
<string>What's important isn't just delivering<lf>the goods, but purr-epping 'em right, too.
<string>We wrap 'em up nice and tight, making sure<lf>they don't shift around during delivery.<lf>You know, getting all scratched up!
<string>That way, not only are they safe and<lf>damage-free but also easier to carry.
<string>Meowdy! <PL>!<lf>You're going off on a once-in-nine-lifetimes<lf>hunt, aren't you?
<string>I'll cover the village while you're<lf>away—I'm much stronger now, y'know!
<string><PL>! You're back!<lf>You made it back!<lf>Oh, am I glad you're safe!
<string>I know you're strong, so you'd be fine,<lf>but still...couldn't help worrying.
<string>Oh.<lf>Meowdy, <PL>!
<string>Going out on a hunt again?<lf>I'd love to hear about it later!
<string>The meowment of truth is almost here,<lf>huh, <PL>?
<string>Well, I'll be suppawting you from<lf>here with some cheers and well<lf>wishes or something!
<string>Once the Rampage is confur-med to<lf>be well 'n' truly over, I wanna go explore<lf>the world outside Kamura. Just for a li'l bit.
<string>Hobashira showed me this picture of that<lf>"O-shun," and it's true—they really are<lf>bigger than rivers, so big they look endless!
<string>I've been wanting to go see one with my own<lf>two eyes ever since, and now it's paw-ssible,<lf>that's just what I'm gonna do! I can't wait!
<string>Heavy loads're easy to shoulder when<lf>your will's as tough as a boulder!
<string>Boats are so cool, the way they<lf>can carry a whole bunch of<lf>things at once with no effur-t.
<string>With them as my ins-purr-ation, I vow<lf>to haul cargo like no Felyne ever before!
<string>Heave, meow! They send over stuff from—<lf>heave, meow—the other side o' the river!
<string>Did you know there's this thing called<lf>an "O-shun" that's bigger than a river?
<string>I mean, a river's already purr-etty big,<lf>so how big are "O-shuns"? I'd love to<lf>see one someday!
<string>They say that "O-shun" waves are completely<lf>different than a river's.
<string>Apparently, they come crashing in all<lf>at once with a "BWOOOSH!" sound.
<string>What that means, I don't know.<lf>Sounds almost like some kind<lf>of weird meownster to me.
<string><PL>! <PL>!<lf>I just heard something unbelievable!
<string>Apparently, an "O-shun" is SALTY!
<string>Which means we can't even drink fur-om it!<lf>"O-shuns" are so overrated. I'd take a river<lf>over one of those any day!
<string>Phew!<lf>Time to get my tail in gear!
