<string>Once upaw-n a time, I worked<lf>at Otemai's, taking stock and<lf>pawing all the accounts there.
<string>But since they needed a purr-oper market<lf>here in the Hub, Otemai asked me to change<lf>careers! Good thing too! I love it here!
<string>Back at the shop, I and everyone else<lf>followed Otemai's instructions, but<lf>here, every decision is my own.
<string>It's a big responsibility with no room<lf>for error, but I'm paw-sitively loving it!
<string><NOFAC>Meow goes it, <PL>?<lf>I'm Maido, welcome to my shop!
<string>We carry all the essentials every<lf>hunter needs, so check here before<lf>heading meow-t that quest gate!

<string>Yomogi is one of Otemai's former<lf>appurr-entices, just like me.
<string>She often comes by the Hub<lf>to hammer meow-t new dango<lf>ideas with her old teacher.
<string>I purr-ovide my services as a taste-tester<lf>too. I gotta say, Yomogi keeps getting<lf>better. Even Otemai's impurr-essed!
<string>Otemai's Bunny Dango are my<lf>go-to, but occasionally I'll paw it<lf>over to Yomogi's place too!
<string>Minoto told me you're gonna hunt<lf>an Apex meownster?
<string>Hey, I wonder what's got her so<lf>on edge this time... Something<lf>to do with Hinoa again, maybe?
<string>Minoto's been constantly stressed<lf>meow-t over this whole Hinoa<lf>resonating thing.
<string>She's actin' like nothing's wrong,<lf>but her mind's someplace else.
<string>If Hinoa quits resonating with that<lf>dragon, maybe we'll get our old Minoto<lf>back. You gotta do something, please!
<string>See all those cherry blossoms in bloom?
<string>Hanamori's grandfather used to<lf>take care of them, and now<lf>Hanamori does in his stead.
<string>They've always been beautiful, ever<lf>since I was kitten... And purr-obably<lf>even before then!
<string>That meownster, Ibushi, was behind<lf>the Rampage all along!
<string>And it hurt Hinoa too... You gotta go<lf>teach that meownster a thing or two!
<string>Time to battle with Ibushi, <PL>!<lf>I know you'll wreck shop meow-t there!<lf>Good luck!
<string>Minoto's all ready to pounce too,<lf>full of motivation to help her sister.
<string>Be careful meow-t there, <PL>!
<string>With the fur-ocious meownster<lf>gone, Minoto's mood seems to<lf>have perked right up!
<string>Maybe it's just my imagination,<lf>but she seems a lot more fur-iendly<lf>to you meow.
<string>When I heard Minoto was resonating,<lf>I was shocked! Appaw-lled even!<lf>I mean, she sits right next to me!
<string>But she seems fit as a fiddle, and doesn't<lf>seem bothered by it one bit. But it's still<lf>kinda fur-eaky sitting next to her...
<string>(Don't tell her I said that...)
<string>Taking down this Narwa thing will<lf>mean Minoto doesn't suffer?
<string>Minoto may look like nothing's wrong,<lf>but occasionally, she'll grimace a bit.<lf>I'm telling you...fur-eaky!
<string>So please, <PL>, defeat Narwa<lf>for the village—for Minoto! And if ya need<lf>anything, you know where to get it!
<string>Now both Hinoa and Minoto are<lf>resonating? Does that mean that<lf>both meownster are still out there?
<string>Looks like you still have work to do...<lf>No time for catnaps yet!
<string>But it's all pawrt of being a Kamura Hunter,<lf>right!? Best be purr-pared! And the best<lf>way to be purr-pared is to shop at Maido's!
<string>Step on up, <PL>!<lf>This here is the number one purr-veyor<lf>of goods fur our number one hunter!
<string>And just in time too. In time for what?<lf>In time to buy something, of course!
<string>I'm billing that one as<lf>"<PL>'s pick!"<lf>Hehehe!
<string>You're finally giving Ibushi and Narwa<lf>their comeuppance, <PL>?
<string>Well, are you purr-repared!? If there's<lf>anything you need to do it, you can<lf>count on your pal Maido to get it for ya!
<string>Ever since you saved Kamura from<lf>the Rampage, your re-purr-tation<lf>has gone through the roof.
<string>So I thought maybe we could sell<lf>something with your pawprint and<lf>signature on it as a souvenir...
<string>But when I pitched the idea, people<lf>weren't too thrilled. Guess it wasn't<lf>a good idea after all.
<string>Earlier, Minoto asked me if<lf>I carried any painting supplies.
<string>I don't, but I told her I'd give her<lf>an extra brush I had at home, and<lf>I think I saw her smile! fur-eaky!
<string>(Don't tell her I said that...)
<string>Anymew, seems like she got inspired watching<lf>Meowster Hojo and wanted to give it a shot.<lf>Hojo's a real wiz with a paintbrush.
<string>Now Minoto's purr-acticing her tail off.<lf>I keep asking if I can see, but she's<lf>too embarrassed to show anyone.
<string>Minoto used to be so much more<lf>bashful when she was a little kid.
<string>She'd just hide behind her twin sister<lf>whenever I tried to talk to her! My<lf>whiskers, how things have changed!
<string>It was cute in its own way, though.<lf>I'm so happy I have the chance<lf>to chat with her here meow!
<string>You know what I heard? Apparently,<lf>Minoto used to be pawful at cooking.
<string>Hinoa was too nice to tell her—<lf>she'd say it was tasty, no matter<lf>how big a disaster the dish was.
<string>One day, Minoto got fed up with herself<lf>and hit the cooking books; now, she's<lf>a culinary meowster!
<string>She's a real purr-fectionist, Minoto.<lf>If people told me my food was tasty,<lf>I'd purr-obably be content with that...
<string>Did you know?<lf>Minoto is actually quite an adept lancer.
<string>A long time ago, it seems she<lf>set meow-t to become a hunter.
<string>When I asked why she gave up,<lf>she said being indoors is more<lf>her style...and she hates bugs.
<string>Hehe! What a character Minoto is!<lf>I'm something of an indoor cat myself.<lf>Must be why we're such good fur-iends!
<string>"A new flavor twist on the Bunny Dango<lf>Hinoa adores!" Hmm...
<string>"New Bunny Dango—<lf>Hinoa-approved!" Hmm...
<string>Meow goes it, <PL>?<lf>I'm trying to come up with some sales<lf>slogans for Otemai's new Bunny Dango.
<string>They were a huge hit with Hinoa, so I'm<lf>tryin' to work that in... But she'd love<lf>any and all dango, knowing Hinoa.
<string>Meaning, that's not gonna sell any<lf>dango, is it? Scratch that then...
<string>Welcome, <PL>!<lf>Wanna hear something cool?
<string>I had a long chat with Otemai for the<lf>first time in a while. She purr-aised<lf>me for how I'm running the market!
<string>I may have moved to a new shop,<lf>but I learned everything I know<lf>from Otemai.
<string>And for her to take notice, I can't tell<lf>you how happy that makes me! Now,<lf>I want to push my sales even fur-ther!
<string>Speaking of which, I gotta get back to work!
<string><PL>!<lf>Is anything troubling you lately?<lf>Purr-haps some retail therapy will help?

<string>Mewhoo! Over here!
<string><NOFAC>Heya, <PL>! Welcome!<lf>I've got something sweet to tail you!
<string>Kagero was fiddling with the melding<lf>pot and came up with a new melding<lf>method!
<string>It takes a bunch of materials, but you'll<lf>get some seriously power-furl talismans!
<string>And that's not all. Kagero prepped the pot<lf>to meld more talismans at once!
<string>Don't you just want to throw stuff in and see<lf>what happens? If you get an itch to meld,<lf>you know where to come to scratch it!
