<string>Hey, you got a sec?
<string>Apologies for springing this on you,<lf>but I have a favor to ask.
<string>I gave the Lunagaron you hunted to the<lf>lab, but they said they needed another<lf>specimen...
<string>And all the hunters and knights I've asked<lf>are busy, so...think you could maybe<lf>source another?
<string>Like I said, apologies for springing this on<lf>you but, if you help me out, I'll give you<lf>a reward. Cool?
<string>Thanks so much!
<string>Oh! You've got a Lunagaron!<lf>That's great! One thing off my long list<lf>of to-dos! And for your reward...
<string>I talked to the Smithy about upgrading<lf>the Blossom Fall switch axe for you.<lf>Isn't that weapon from your hometown?
<string>Anyway, I better get back to it. I'll never<lf>get to visit my wife and daughter if<lf>I don't get done with all this work.

<string>So you're the hunter they sent, huh?<lf>I'm Calgo, pleased to meet you!
<string>The people here, well some of them<lf>may not look like it, but they are all<lf>dependable.
<string>You can trust them all with your life,<lf>and that includes me too!
<string>I know you're new around here, but<lf>I'm sure you'll find your bearings.
<string>Even though it's just an outpost, Elgado<lf>is a pretty great place. The only drawback<lf>I'd say is that, well...it's an outpost.
<string>And if you got family back home, like I do,<lf>then it's easy to get homesick.
<string>But I'm guessin' you already know<lf>how I feel...
<string>I saw a friend of yours earlier. The way<lf>he carried himself, I could tell right away<lf>he was a hunter from your village.
<string>But I haven't seen him since then...<lf>What? He left already? Ah, really?<lf>I was hopin' I could talk to him...
<string>Hey there, welcome back. That master of<lf>yours... Utsushi, was it? I guess he must<lf>miss you a lot, huh? I can relate...
<string>Look, he may be your master but he's<lf>probably raised ya like you were his own,<lf>so... Go see him sometimes, OK?
<string>I'll leave the dangerous stuff to The Order<lf>and you hunters. Leave all the small<lf>stuff to me.
<string>Speaking of which, if you bring back any<lf>useful information, we can make good use<lf>of it!
<string>It'd be great if I could discuss it with my<lf>boss, but I have no idea where he is! He'll<lf>be back soon! I think... (I hope...)
<string>So looks like you're getting settled in.<lf>Good, good. Glad to hear it!
<string>Looks like everyone is expecting you<lf>to participate in the investigation now.<lf>Yep, it's official and everything!
<string>You've already been recognized by<lf>The Order as someone who is worthy<lf>to join them. That's a big deal!
<string>It's rare to see Admiral Galleus so upset...<lf>But as a father and a senior researcher<lf>here, I understand how he feels.
<string>When you're young, you think you're<lf>invincible and do all kinds of stupid stuff.<lf>Just something we all go through, I guess...
<string>Hey, good work out there! Thanks to you,<lf>I got to see some pretty interesting stuff!<lf>We'll be busy, but busy's good!
<string>Wish I could talk to my boss about it,<lf>but who knows where he's run off to...
<string>Sorry to get you involved in this mess,<lf>when there's so much going on, but could<lf>you go out and bring my boss back, please?
<string>Yes, he's a pain in the posterior, and yes,<lf>he's selfish, too selfish for his own good<lf>even, but he's still a good friend.
<string>We also really need him back here. But<lf>I can guarantee that bringing him back<lf>will be of some use to you, as well!
<string>He what? You went all the way out there,<lf>saved his butt and he didn't even say thanks...<lf>That guy I swear...
<string>Well, you have my thanks! I'll treat you<lf>to a drink sometime. No excuses now,<lf>ya hear?
<string>Finally, one of the big fellas, huh? I can<lf>feel Admiral Galleus's enthusiasm all the<lf>way over here!
<string>Of course, as a member of the Guild,<lf>I'm sure your efforts will help us get<lf>this investigation off the ground!
<string>And as a father, I want to see the results<lf>as soon as possible so I can go home<lf>and see my daughter!
<string>You did it! Culan couldn't contain her<lf>excitement when the report came in.
<string>The data on this bad boy is gonna jump-<lf>start our research! I'm sure everyone<lf>on the research team is raring to go!
<string>Thanks to you, things are starting to<lf>pick up! Next thing you know, I'll be<lf>back with my daughter in no time!
<string>That's so strange. Garangolm are supposedly<lf>docile creatures, and out of nowhere<lf>suddenly one turns violent?
<string>It's also strange why my daughter, who<lf>never left my side when she was little,<lf>doesn't talk to me anymore...
<string>...Did I do something wrong? I really don't<lf>know what to make of girls her age, they're<lf>just as mysterious as these monsters!
<string>Another urgent quest already? Wow,<lf>not even time to enjoy your dango...
<string>Don't be afraid to ask others for help if you<lf>need it. But, uh, don't ask me though. I can<lf>barely lift a weapon, much less use one!
<string>Talk about an entrance! Never would<lf>have expected that to happen!
<string>I mean, everyone's been waiting for<lf>Malzeno to show up, but definitely<lf>not like that!
<string>To be completely honest with you, I'm pretty<lf>excited myself, but I'm trying my best not<lf>to let it show in front of the others.
<string><VO:SER>I can't believe it... You think she's<lf>gonna be OK?
<string>I mean, everyone in Elgado is kinda<lf>like family, you know? She's almost<lf>like everyone's big sister.
<string>Everybody's worried sick about her<lf>so I'm gonna go check on her later.<lf>We need to get her back on her feet!
<string>It's good to hear you found the doctor!<lf>And great that he already knows how<lf>to treat her!
<string>I guess we don't have anything more<lf>to worry about! Do we...?
<string>C'mon, we've got the best research team<lf>around, the doctor who saved the Kingdom,<lf>and you! What more could we ask for?
<string>Using deadly poison...? I'm aware this<lf>is all for the sake of medicine, but still<lf>it makes me feel uneasy...
<string>Regardless, Fiorayne will have to sit<lf>tight for a while longer. I'm sure she'll<lf>be able to hold out, at least I hope so.
<string>Fiorayne's back on her feet and acting<lf>like nothing happened! Well, I guess that<lf>gives us one less thing to worry about.
<string>I gotta say, when she was ill, it hit me<lf>pretty hard. All I could think about was<lf>my daughter...
<string>Of course, as a senior researcher, I have<lf>a job to do, and I can't let my emotions<lf>affect my work...
<string>But in all honesty, I was freaking out!<lf>But let's keep that a little secret between<lf>you and me, OK?
<string>You did it! And you came back in one<lf>piece, too!
<string>I've heard from the Admiral that we're<lf>still going to continue our investigation,<lf>but... First we need to celebrate!
<string>What!? Heading out on another quest already?<lf>I guess with so many people depending on<lf>you it's hard to catch a break.
<string>With Malzeno gone, I thought maybe our<lf>research would go a little more smoothly,<lf>but I guess not...
<string>I'm sure whatever I'm going through<lf>pales in comparison to what you have<lf>to deal with...
<string>But we've been working together for<lf>a while now and sometimes I just blurt<lf>stuff out... Sorry!
<string>Some pretty crazy weather we're having...<lf>It's been a while since I've seen clouds<lf>this dark!
<string>Hmmm. If the weather gets worse, we'll<lf>probably call it quits for the day.
<string>I'd say you should do the same, but<lf>the hunt must go on, rain or shine,<lf>right?
<string>Off to the Citadel again, huh?
<string>I dread to think what would happen if<lf>Malzeno showed up again, but at least<lf>we could settle things once and for all.
<string>So this is it, huh? It's terrifying, but if you<lf>defeated one devil, surely you can defeat<lf>two!
<string>And even if it has help from the Qurio,<lf>you don't need to worry!
<string>You've got all of Elgado backing you up!<lf>I know you can do it! Everyone does!<lf>Be strong and come back to us safe!
<string>I'm sure it's not just the Admiral who feels<lf>this way, but the whole of Elgado. We all<lf>want you to stay.
<string>Of course we all rely on your hunting skills,<lf>but there's another reason why I want you<lf>to stay. And I'm sure others would agree.
<string>Not only do we think of you as family, but<lf>you have such a positive impact on all of us.<lf>Just wouldn't be the same without you!
<string>I know it's hard being away from your<lf>home, believe me I know, but please<lf>consider staying. Please!
<string>I know we already have you hunters and<lf>the knights, but a little more hands or<lf>paws in the field would be welcome.
<string>And with us THIS close to that crater,<lf>I swear, anything can happen!
<string>Let's try to wrap things up here as soon<lf>as possible so we can all go home to our<lf>families in one piece!
<string>They put me in charge of the research team<lf>here, so if anyone's slacking off, you let me<lf>know, OK?
<string>For the most part everyone's been working<lf>hard, but sometimes it feels like the Guild<lf>sent me out here to babysit...
<string>Feelin' homesick yet? Don't worry, I think<lf>we all do. I know I do!
<string>Earlier today, I got a letter from my wife<lf>who's back in the capital.
<string>She says the house has been so quiet<lf>without me there. I'd better get home<lf>soon!
<string>I'm a little sad, though. My daughter hasn't<lf>sent me any letters... I miss her so much!
<string>Malzeno is a monster feared by people of the<lf>Kingdom. There's so many stories about it,<lf>but I'm not sure what's true and what's not.
<string>All I know is that I want to find out exactly<lf>where its nest is, no matter what. I'm sure<lf>everyone here feels the same way.
<string>I want to protect my family. That's one<lf>of the main reasons I came to this outpost.
<string>Come to think of it, it's not like all of this<lf>will end with the defeat of Malzeno. It's<lf>gonna be a while before we can go home.
<string>I mean, I'm in no rush anyway. I'm sure<lf>my daughter will appreciate me more the<lf>longer I'm gone!
<string>...<lf>That's how these things work right?<lf>Yeah, I'm sure of it! Heh...
<string>Hunter! You won't believe it! I finally got<lf>a letter from my daughter! It's been so long!<lf>You want to know why she sent it?
<string>She said she heard stories of a famous<lf>hunter and was proud of me for being<lf>able to work with you!
<string>It feels like I've gotten a little of my<lf>dignity back as a parent. You have<lf>my thanks, Hunter!
