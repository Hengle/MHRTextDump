<string>So the Kingdom's outpost sounds super<lf>interesting...
<string>But with you leaving, the village's safety<lf>rests solely on my shoulders. If I leave, my<lf>top-secret mission would be in jeopardy.
<string>I mean, it's no biggie. You get to go off<lf>to exotic locales while I'm stuck on this<lf>bridge, picking up your slack.
<string>But if you brought me back a souvenir,<lf>I might call it even.
<string>After you left, my brother became<lf>obsessed with trying to get an<lf>umbrella from the Kingdom.
<string>He finally got his hands on one and<lf>he's been messing around with it<lf>ever since.
<string>He was going on and on about all the<lf>subtle differences. The differences<lf>in shape, materials, yadda yadda...
<string>I just kept nodding my head.<lf>I mean, it's just an umbrella.<lf>Sheesh...
<string>Whenever I'm not sure what to have<lf>for dinner, I always ask Minoto or Kojiri.<lf>They always make the best food.
<string>I wish I could cook like them, and I've<lf>tried! But every time I try to recreate one<lf>of their dishes, it's just not the same...
<string>Minoto's food always has this perfect<lf>presentation and is super nutritious. I<lf>feel like that's the secret to her beauty.
<string>Kojiri's food is all about the flavor.<lf>Oh my Gog, my mouth is watering<lf>just thinking about it...
<string>I wish they'd cook for me every day.<lf>Wait— I wonder if I can convince<lf>them to cook for us somehow...
<string>Hey, hey, <PL>.<lf>Welcome back. What's new?
<string>You didn't come back to check on<lf>Kamura, did ya? Don't worry! Us<lf>defenders have got it covered!
<string>And with super-secret Agent Hinami<lf>on the scene, nothing's gettin' in<lf>through those gates.
<string>You can just sit back and enjoy your<lf>visit! Kamura is in good hands...and<lf>paws!
<string>Kajika often comes here to go fishing.<lf>Whenever he spots one, he dives in,<lf>whiskers first!
<string>At first, it freaked me out. I ran through<lf>the village screaming, "HELP! Kajika<lf>fell in the river!"
<string>But Elder Fugen just casually walked<lf>up to me and said, "It's OK, Hinami.<lf>He does this all the time."
<string>But after I saw how calm Kajika looked<lf>diving off, I realized I had no reason to<lf>worry. Now it's like a regular thing.
<string>Hey, <PL>. You ever<lf>seen what's behind that cloth Kagero<lf>wears over his face?
<string>It's really been buggin' me lately!<lf>You're not the least bit curious?<lf>Come on. You want to know, right!?
<string>You know, I actually asked him about<lf>it once. He told me, "Mine is a face,<lf>no one would care to look at..."
<string>I was like, "If that's the case, then<lf>just show us your dang face!"
<string>My brother's even sick of me talking<lf>about it. But the more I think about it,<lf>the more I want to see it!
