<string><NOFAC>Good day to you!<lf>You're a hunter of the village<lf>of Kamura, are you not?
<string>Please, excuse my sudden intrusion.<lf>I am Rondine, at your service.
<string>As you can see, I am a trader<lf>traveling the seas from a far-off<lf>land to the west.
<string>I am making a stop in my travels here<lf>so that I may trade with the people<lf>of this wonderous village.
<string>Trading is a marvelous activity, no?<lf>'Tis where people of various settlements<lf>mingle through goods. Very profound.
<string>It may be a while before I can<lf>open up shop, but please, feel<lf>free to drop by at any time.
<string>Farewell!<lf>Do come by if you wish to enjoy<lf>the wonders of travel and trade!
<string>Are you perhaps familiar with Sir Hamon<lf>the Blacksmith? As a hunter of this<lf>village you must have used his services.
<string>That man's smithing skills are<lf>a sight to behold.
<string>I've traveled many a land, but I have<lf>never met a craftsman of his caliber.
<string>I would love to talk to him at<lf>some point in time...

<string>I would love to talk to him at<lf>some point in time...
<string><VO:SER>The Rampage... To think that this<lf>land has been plagued by such<lf>a calamity!
<string><VO:NOR>It must have been fate that I came<lf>upon this place. Very well: I shall<lf>base my operations here for now.
<string>If you and your village intend to confront<lf>these monsters, then my wares will no<lf>doubt be of use to you.

<string><VO:NOR>It must have been fate that I came<lf>upon this place. Very well: I shall<lf>base my operations here for now.
<string>If you and your village intend to confront<lf>these monsters, then my wares will no<lf>doubt be of use to you.
<string>Ah, Hunter.<lf>I hear the Rampage is upon us.
<string>I have some experience with a long sword<lf>and so thought to provide my help...
<string>However, I was politely turned down by<lf>your Elder Fugen. "We couldn't forgive<lf>ourselves if you got hurt," he said.
<string>And since Chino and Kotori too have<lf>objected, I shall stand aside for now.
<string>Iori has told me that you were<lf>attacked by this "Magnamalo."
<string>It is but a legend in my homeland.<lf>I've read writings of its existence,<lf>but I did not expect to see it here.
<string>Nevertheless, I am glad to see you and<lf>the villagers safe. Waiting here doing<lf>nothing has been tortuous to say the least.
<string>I hear Sir Hamon has designed some<lf>sort of counterattack "device."
<string>Sir Hamon's skills as a craftsman<lf>never fail to amaze me. One might<lf>easily describe them as godly, even.
<string>If we could possess such technique...
<string>...Oh. Please, I implore that you<lf>ignore what I said.
<string>Ah, Hunter.<lf>Your gaze is as piercing as ever.<lf>Something on your mind?
<string>...I see.<lf>So you're after the Magnamalo then.<lf>That explains the steely look.
<string>Well, try not to overthink it.<lf>Success is well within your reach.
<string>It appears that Iori and Yomogi<lf>have been in good spirits ever<lf>since you defeated Magnamalo.
<string>I had noticed they were worried about<lf>something, but I suppose that's now<lf>been resolved.
<string>Oh, but please, don't spoil it for me.<lf>Teenage years are by definition when one<lf>wades through a deep mist of malaise...
<string>We adults mustn't interfere at a whim<lf>unless they want us to. Else we might<lf>confuse them even more.
<string>The proper response would instead be<lf>to strictly observe, while being ready<lf>to lend a hand when it is needed.
<string>Ah, Hunter. Have you by chance visited the<lf>Gathering Hub? I hear it's where Hunters<lf>go to meet with their compatriots.
<string>As a matter of fact, I was invited<lf>by the people there for some<lf>evening drinks.
<string>The numerous rounds of spirits mixed with<lf>a splendid atmosphere and good company...<lf>I felt quite at home. What a wonderful time!
<string>This village is truly a delightful place.<lf>I must visit again, more for leisure<lf>than business.
<string><VO:SER>The Rampage is a force that has never<lf>appeared in my country, though we<lf>are all well aware of its existence.
<string>It occurs in some regions at intervals<lf>of several decades at a time, and in<lf>some regions, never at all.
<string>The species of monsters are varied,<lf>but still attack as a horde.
<string>It is a bizarre, inexplicable phenomenon.<lf>If there are clues for resolving it, only<lf>then might there be a chance to...

<string>Perhaps it is because I'm foreign,<lf>but the children of the village seem<lf>to enjoy coming to pay me a visit.
<string>Except, the other day, the children told me,<lf>"You don't look like a merchant."
<string>Hmmm... That simply doesn't make sense.<lf>This merchant disguise should be infallible—
<string>Uh...haha...ha...ha...<lf>I am teasing. YES! Teasing! I am but a regular<lf>seafaring trader. Certainly not a hunter...

<string>Uh...haha...ha...ha...<lf>I am teasing. YES! Teasing! I am but a regular<lf>seafaring trader. Certainly not a hunter...
<string><VO:SER>So, the Arzuros leading a horde<lf>of monsters is an "Apex"?
<string>I hunted an Arzuros several years ago<lf>after receiving an order to do so.
<string>I remember it being rather easy,<lf>going down with but a single hit.<lf>Perhaps an Apex will be much more—
<string>......
<string>Please excuse me. I meant that, uh, I heard of<lf>hunting Arzuros being easy. I am but a mere<lf>trader with ZERO hunting experience. ZERO...!
<string><VO:SER>I have been told of what happened. Still,<lf>I'm pleased to hear that Miss Hinoa's<lf>situation is not as dire as first thought.
<string>We have tried to ascertain the identity<lf>of the blue monster, but alas, if only we<lf>could've been of more help.
<string>Nonetheless, it was separated from<lf>all the other rampaging monsters.<lf>That itself is noteworthy.
<string>Its species aside, given the timing of<lf>its appearance, I can't help but feel<lf>there is something unusual about it...
<string>In my homeland, a certain group of<lf>hunters commanded by our queen is tasked<lf>with countering any threat of monsters.
<string>These hunters are called "knights,"<lf>as ostentatious a title as it is.
<string>However, their role is akin to that<lf>of the defenders of this village.
<string>There may be differences in name and<lf>standing, but their solemn resolves to<lf>protect their homes is no different.
<string><VO:SER>Well well. The elder dragon—Ibushi the<lf>Wind Serpent—was the root of the Rampage.
<string>I had heard that you will face it.<lf>I implored our Queen to allow me<lf>to aid you, but...
<string>Her Majesty put forth her concern over<lf>my safety, and responded with the words<lf>"Please do not."
<string>I am afraid I am bound by Her Majesty's<lf>orders. I am...truly sorry for being<lf>unable to assist you at such a time.
<string><VO:SER>Back home, I tend to keep an eye out for<lf>our Queen's subtleties, and am familiar<lf>in assessing the condition of others.
<string>And by my appraisal, Miss Hinoa<lf>acts like she is fine, but is in fact<lf>still ill.
<string>Whether she can be saved or not<lf>shall be dependent on your hunt<lf>of Ibushi. Do take care, Hunter.
<string>Splendid work, Hunter.<lf>The Rampage has not yet abated,<lf>but it is still a step towards its end.
<string>I see Miss Hinoa has recovered well.<lf>And having her as her former self<lf>has lifted the moods of the villagers.
<string>I've been told that hunters from<lf>all over are now preparing to<lf>hunt down the Thunder Serpent.
<string>A new species of elder dragon, and<lf>a cataclysmic one at that... Hunting<lf>it would no doubt bring prestige.
<string>When it is found and a quest is given,<lf>Hunters will jump at the opportunity.
<string>Be sure that your chance at glory<lf>is not snatched away from you.
<string>So, Hunter.<lf>Headed to do battle with Narwa, are you?
<string>I had come to Kamura bearing a<lf>certain mission. But I never imagined<lf>I would witness such a critical event.
<string>Upon your safe return, I shall disclose<lf>my true purpose. I've already spent<lf>enough time hiding it from you.
<string><VO:SER>Well then. This is meant only for you:
<string>My identity as a trader is but a facade.<lf>In truth, I am a knight of my kingdom,<lf>sent to Kamura by my queen's order.
<string>Of course, knight is merely a name<lf>for hunters who serves Her Majesty.<lf>It means little else.
<string>The order given was to bring the<lf>Blacksmith of Kamura to our lands, and<lf>negotiate the application of his skills.
<string>But after getting to know the people,<lf>I've concluded that negotiating under<lf>false pretenses was dishonorable.
<string>So, I've decided that we will return<lf>with the technology only with Kamura's<lf>blessing. Until then, I am but a trader.

<string>There you are. People are talking—time<lf>for battle, is it?
<string>Your abilities are beyond formidable, but<lf>you'll now be up against the two elder<lf>dragons responsible for the Rampage.
<string>A single mistake can lead to tragedy...<lf>So please, stay vigilant. I shall be praying<lf>for your victory, Hunter.
<string>Thanks to your valiant efforts,<lf>the Rampage finally nears its<lf>end. A splendid feat! Bravo!
<string>Kamura has always been lively, but<lf>now it's bound to have many more visitors,<lf>and become that much more vibrant.
<string>To me, this village is my second home...<lf>and it is a joy to see the place I love<lf>so greatly thrive.
<string>Good day to you! So, the Rampage comes to<lf>its long-awaited close, and Kamura Village<lf>begins to regain its vim and vigor...
<string>...Hmm. As a trader, I suppose now is<lf>the time to make my own contribution<lf>to the rejuvenation of this village...
<string>What? Merchanting may have been a disguise<lf>but I've worn it for so long now, it's become<lf>quite an inseparable part of me, you know!
<string>Trade goods retain the scent and history<lf>of places far away. Imagining their<lf>origins can fill you with wonder.
<string>Trade is itself a form of wonder.<lf>It connects people beyond the incredible<lf>vastness of the seas through goods.
<string>I must admit. This job is much more<lf>satisfying than I thought.
<string>Hunter, you were born and raised in<lf>Kamura, were you not? Have you ever<lf>traveled to other—Ah, no?
<string>No need to feel self-conscious about it.<lf>There's naught wrong with it at all.
<string>But visiting places unseen expands your<lf>horizons, refining you as a person.<lf>It is something I would recommend.
<string><VO:SER>Miss Yomogi and Miss Komitsu came by<lf>the other day with some Bunny Dango<lf>and a candied apple for me.
<string>At first I assumed that they wanted to<lf>sell them, but it turned out they simply<lf>wanted me to try the local cuisine.
<string>I felt rather guilty for thinking<lf>they had ulterior motives, honestly.
<string><VO:NOR>And the samples were exquisite.<lf>I might even sell their food just to let<lf>the rest of world know of its existence.
<string>Hunter! Listen!<lf>I've just had the encounter of<lf>my life at the Gathering Hub!
<string>It feels like I've been utterly charmed!<lf>By Master Utsushi! Surely you must<lf>know him as a hunter!?
<string>It's the monster masks that he makes!<lf>The moment I saw them, I felt a shock<lf>reverberating through my heart!
<string>A breakdown of the norm, a sensibility<lf>hitherto unseen! It's not just a mask,<lf>but a grand opus of even greater value!
<string>Master Utsushi's masks are art. I wish<lf>I could sell them on my ship, but alas,<lf>it'd be too much for me to arrange.
<string>So instead, I advised the dockworkers<lf>that they should export them.
<string>They gave me a confused look, but they<lf>did say they would talk to the merchants<lf>about it, so I'm positive it'll happen.
<string>When those things are out in the market,<lf>I know they will sell out in a flash.
<string>The sisters Hinoa and Minoto have been<lf>asking me about my homeland. It seemed<lf>that they were interested in travel.
<string>I offered to take them on a voyage<lf>when the Rampage has been resolved,<lf>but they declined.
<string>Miss Hinoa because she could not live<lf>without Bunny Dango, and Miss Minoto<lf>because she didn't like being outside.
<string>Unfortunate.<lf>I wish they would muster some courage<lf>and mettle, and take a step forward.
<string>There is something about Kamura<lf>that gives a sense of nostalgia<lf>even to a first-time visitor.
<string>Perhaps it's the refreshing locale<lf>and kindness of the villagers that<lf>help heal one's body and mind.
<string>The village has become a special place<lf>for me. I hope my countrymen will have<lf>a chance to experience it as well.
<string>A new stage of splendor awaits!
<string><NOFAC>Hunter, we are finally ready! Ready for<lf>the most magnificent <COLS RED>trading</COL> you and I shall<lf>EVER undertake! Allow me to explain.
<string>First: You will borrow this submarine, which<lf>you may use to send a Buddy to far-off<lf>markets to collect items of your choosing.

<string>A moment, if you would?
<string><NOFAC>I have a client interested in acquiring<lf>some of Kamura's local specialties.<lf>Would you kindly provide me with a few?

<string>Well? Should you find this suggestion<lf>agreeable, you only need supply<lf>a small number of local goods.
<string>As always, please deliver them<lf>to the Guild, and they shall<lf>send them to me.
