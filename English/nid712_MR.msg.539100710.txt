<string>Why, hello. You're the hunter I just saw<lf>with Dame Fiorayne. Hm-hm-hm, how<lf>interesting.
<string>It's been a little dull around here as<lf>of late, but I think things are about<lf>to get much more...interesting.
<string>Whether I'm interested in listening to<lf>it or not, all I hear recently in Elgado<lf>is chatter about you.
<string>And what I've heard, well, I do hope<lf>it's true.
<string>Finding someone to...keep up with you<lf>is a quest in of itself. Perhaps you feel<lf>the same?
<string>So, that tall drink of water... The one<lf>in the mask. Is he perhaps a hunter too?
<string>Some men do the strangest things,<lf>but I'm not complaining. Just makes<lf>me more interested in your homeland.
<string>I'm not sure what he was teaching you,<lf>but Master Arlow seems pretty pleased<lf>with the results. Mmhmmm.
<string>I myself am rather interested in what you<lf>can...teach me. Perhaps we can talk in<lf>private sometime?
<string>Everyone's barely keeping it together,<lf>but you're cool and collected. Work well<lf>under pressure, do you? Good... I like that.
<string>You know what they say, can't stand<lf>the heat...
<string>First time in the Jungle, huh? I guess it<lf>doesn't matter where you do something<lf>if you're good at it.
<string>But then again, I guess you already<lf>knew that.
<string>Looks like you took care of business,<lf>huh? Good. I'm gonna give your report<lf>a thorough review.
<string>But don't think that means I'll be joining<lf>you anytime soon. I'm more of a solo gal,<lf>if you know what I mean.
<string>I feel for the Kingdom and the people<lf>affected by this whole situation, of course...
<string>But as hunters, this is exactly what we live<lf>for. Peace and quiet is so boring, isn't it?<lf>I know you're thinking the same thing...
<string>Oh, I'm just teasing you, silly.<lf>Ignore what I said.
<string>I think I'll sit this one out. If you want<lf>to go out chasing that fool, be my guest.<lf>I'll be right here.
<string>Oh, he's not a bad person, per se.<lf>It's just— Well, you'll see...
<string>Welcome back. Have a good time?
<string>So...you met Bahari, did you? Doesn't<lf>leave the best first impression, does he?
<string>I guess if the Order are going along then<lf>there's no need for me to get involved,<lf>is there?
<string>As much as I'd like to take on one of <lf>the Three Lords, the quest is a little <lf>too crowded for my liking.
<string>But I'm not sweatin' it. There'll be<lf>plenty of other chances. Have fun.~♪
<string>So...he's back, is he? *sigh* I suppose<lf>it can't be helped. We do need his<lf>expertise...
<string>But since you're here I guess you can<lf>keep him busy for me. Or at least keep<lf>him away from me...
<string>Sorry for pushing this onto you, but<lf>it's for the sake of our research, and<lf>for the Kingdom, am I right? Hehe.
<string>So these new little creatures might<lf>have something to do with all this, hmm?
<string>This whole time we had no idea it was<lf>happening right in front of us...
<string>But Fiorayne did. She's quite impressive,<lf>wouldn't you say? I suppose that's why she<lf>holds such a high position in the Order.
<string>Lunagaron are such savage creatures as<lf>it is. This one even more so... But I'm sure<lf>you'll handle yourself just fine out there.
<string>It's probably nothing to what you were<lf>up against back in Kamura? Or am I<lf>putting too much stock in you, hmm?
<string>You seem to attract all the fun stuff.<lf>I can see why...
<string>But hogging all the fun, it's almost<lf>criminal...
<string>Maybe I should join you sometime. You<lf>wouldn't mind sharing some of that fun<lf>with me, hmmm?
<string>To think such a tiny thing could do in the<lf>great Fiorayne. I guess I underestimated<lf>them...
<string>I'd rather do my own thing, but I can't<lf>be selfish at a time like this. Elgado<lf>must stand together.
<string>And if there's anything I can do for<lf>Fiorayne, please, let me know.
<string>Finding a doctor so quickly is in part<lf>thanks to you and your Kamura<lf>connections. I'm glad you're here.
<string>I don't believe in destiny, or fate,<lf>but this is an interesting coincidence.
<string>Hmhm. Now I'm interested in what you're<lf>going to pull off next. You aren't finished<lf>yet, are you?
<string>Heading out? I'll see you when you get back.
<string>This hunt belongs to you and Fiorayne,<lf>after everything you've both done to<lf>protect the research team.
<string>Hmmm. Sorry if that put undue pressure<lf>on you. That wasn't my intention.
<string>No need to worry, either. If you fail, I'll be<lf>here to step in and finish Malzeno off.<lf>So go fail in style. *wink*
<string>Hmhm. You're something special.<lf>I underestimated you. Mmmhmm...<lf>You're a REAL hunter.
<string>Do you understand what that means?<lf>It means, you're the first one in a long<lf>time I feel like going out hunting with.
<string>But, of course, there's no rush. Hehe.<lf>That is...if you'd like to.
<string>I've received a request to help with the<lf>research too. Once they see we can help<lf>out, they're going to work us both hard.
<string>I should probably laud the flexibility of<lf>the Admiral in this, though. Using hunters<lf>as well as the Order—he's smart.
<string>A lot of folk in the Kingdom are fixated<lf>on appearances, but he isn't one of them.
<string>A far rarer breed—one who truly sees<lf>what needs to be done to achieve his goals.
<string>Bahari's theories are all fine on paper.<lf>But are they realistic? Coexistence with<lf>the new host, and so soon?
<string>I've got this terrible feeling that we're all<lf>overlooking something big here.
<string>So the fairy-tale monster is the true<lf>host, hmm? Things just get more and<lf>more intense here.
<string>Not that this will send me rushing into<lf>battle. No need to worry about that.
<string>Just like when we first met, I'll be waiting<lf>here. Waiting for you to return to Elgado.
<string>I like to think I've done my fair share<lf>around here, but I have to admit it,<lf>you've overtaken me completely.
<string>I need to stop standing around being<lf>impressed by someone else, and start<lf>doing impressive things of my own.
<string>I'm surprised to find these feelings inside<lf>myself... But I'm not complaining, I'm<lf>pleasantly surprised. Hehe.
<string>Those Wirebugs of yours...<lf>Can I take a closer look? ...Interesting.
<string>So they're the real deal, huh? It's not<lf>every day you get to see actual<lf>Kamura-born-and-raised Wirebugs.
<string>So everyone fights the Rampage<lf>in Kamura, hmm? Not just hunters.
<string>That kind of environment breeds innovation.<lf>No wonder Kamura develops so many new<lf>hunting techniques.
<string>I'm interested to learn more, perhaps<lf>you'll take me some time?
<string>You know, you can learn a lot hanging out<lf>here. There's a lot to see if you just take<lf>a moment to take it all in...
<string>What's being forged at the Smithy. What's<lf>being sold at the Market. Who's taking<lf>on what from the Quest Board.
<string>I quite enjoy watching everyone run around.<lf>Especially a particular busy bee. *wink*
<string>Tell me. When Malzeno was staring you<lf>down, were you afraid?
<string>Holding onto that fear, and then making<lf>good use of it, is the mark of a true<lf>hunter.
<string>Don't let yourself become numb to fear.<lf>Your core hunter instincts will tell you<lf>so much—and keep you alive.
<string>The Chevaliers must have some kind of<lf>special assignment, otherwise they wouldn't<lf>be posted here. That makes sense.
<string>Seeing how closely they work with the<lf>Admiral... No offense, I like and respect<lf>the guy, but that's not my scene.
<string>You know, I was actually invited to try<lf>out for the Chevaliers, but I flat out refused.
<string>Don't get me wrong, it's a cool opportunity.<lf>But like I said, it's not for me.
<string>I guess I'll stay here a little longer<lf>if you're going to stay.
<string>You have a knack for attracting interesting<lf>monsters, so I get the feeling we're not<lf>done yet. Just a hunch I have. Mmhmmm.
<string>Maybe we can finally go on a quest<lf>together. Hehe.
