<string>Oh, hello, <PL>.<lf>Everyone tells me you're heading for<lf>the Kingdom's outpost.
<string>I wrote a poem for you.<lf>Think of it as a parting gift...<lf>*ahem*
<string>"Our hero departs<lf>Gone with the breeze like blossoms<lf>A new tale unfolds"
<string>*sigh* Certainly not my best work...<lf>Oh, well. Have a safe journey.
<string>So...how's Elgado? I imagine it's full<lf>of refined and cultured people, like<lf>myself, no?
<string>Sure would be nice to visit such a place.<lf>Anything to escape the mundane life<lf>of this village... *ahem*
<string>"Your shores call to me<lf>Grand kingdom by the ocean<lf>Will we ever meet?"
<string>Take this with you to Elgado. Perhaps<lf>my poetry will become as famous as<lf>tales of your deeds.
<string>Fiorayne and Rondine are both so<lf>beautiful, don't you think? Such<lf>beauty is so inspiring! *ahem*
<string>"Beautiful sisters<lf>Shine bright like a star-filled sky<lf>Unmatched radiance"
<string>Hmmm... Not bad, not bad.<lf>Could be better. How about...<lf>*ahem*
<string>"Forever shining<lf>Your radiance fills the sky<lf>Like stars in the night"
<string>Hmm, yes, yes. Much better!<lf>I swear, I surprise even myself<lf>sometimes!
<string>I've heard that there's a ferocious<lf>monster out there that once brought the<lf>Kingdom to its knees. Do be careful...
<string>I have composed a poem for you.<lf>Listen well and let its words spark<lf>the flame within your very soul.
<string>"Malzeno, the foul<lf>Show yourself and face your fate<lf>Your end is at hand"
<string>I pray these words guide your hand as<lf>you strike down this terrible foe. Bind<lf>it to memory during your next hunt.
<string>Oh, <PL>...<lf>I didn't know you were home.<lf>Welcome back.
<string>Your very presence is enough to get<lf>my poetic juices flowing. I feel it,<lf>another poem is singing to my soul!
<string>"Back from Elgado<lf>No souvenirs to be seen<lf>My hands are empty..."
<string>C'mon! I'm not asking for much.<lf>At least a spoon! They do have<lf>spoons there, don't they!? Hmph...
<string>Kagero the Merchant certainly has an<lf>air of mystery about him, doesn't he?
<string>So, I decided to make a poem in<lf>homage to him. *ahem*
<string>"Hey, where are you from?<lf>What's this about the Tea Shop?<lf>Come on! Show your face!"
<string>I've tried to express exactly what<lf>most people in the village are<lf>probably thinking.
