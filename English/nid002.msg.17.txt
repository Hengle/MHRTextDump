<string>All this work is making me hungry!
<string><NOFAC><CAM:11>Oh, <PL>! Already completed<lf>your hunter registration!? Great!
<string>I retrieved your <COLS RED>Cohoot</COL> from Elder<lf>Fugen earlier. It's so cute! You're<lf>gonna love it!
<string><NOTE:226>Cohoots, like Buddies, will help<lf>you out during quests. But in<lf>their own little way.
<string><OWL>Well, how about you give your<lf>new feathery friend a name!
<string>Anyway, since my sister is swamped<lf>at the moment, I'll go ahead and give<lf>you the quest rundown instead.
<string>Now that you're a hunter, you'll be in<lf>charge of completing the quests that<lf>me and Minoto have in our quest lists.
<string>Some of these quests, called<lf><COLS RED>Key Quests</COL>, have been specially<lf>posted by the Hunter's Guild...
<string>So, if you make a point of completing Key<lf>Quests, the Hunter's Guild will take note.
<string>...Oh, and one last thing! Here:<lf>Take this <COLS RED>Petalace</COL> Minoto and I made.
<string>As you may be aware, Petalaces<lf>are protection charms woven from<lf>a local plant called a Sending Sprig.
<string><NOTE:083>Pollen carried by <COLS RED>Spiribirds</COL> will enhance<lf>your Petalace, strengthening your abilities.<lf>Treat it with care.
<string>...Oh, I think Minoto should be wrapping<lf>up her report right about now.
<string>And I need to get back to work, myself.<lf>Once you're ready, you can start taking<lf>quests from either of us.
<string><NPC:8>Hold on! You can't go purr-rancing off<lf>before my introduction!
<string><CAM:8,9><PL>, meowllo! And 'gratz on<lf>becoming a hunter!
<string>If you ever find yourself taking a Hub<lf>Quest, then I, <COLS RED>Senri the Mailman</COL>, have<lf>quite the impurr-tant info for ya!
<string>You'll need to go through me<lf>to meet up with fellow hunters!<lf>Make sure to stop by!
<string><FCAM:45.0><NPC:2>*giggle* Well, I think that about<lf>wraps everything up! Time to start<lf>monster hunting!
<string>What wonderful weather.
<string>Well, hello there, <PL>!<lf>Ready to get into some quests?
<string>Well, you have great timing because<lf>a quest just came in for you.
<string><COLS RED>Master Utsushi</COL> has called for you.<lf>Looks like it's time for some basic<lf>training.
<string>He was so pumped up about being<lf>a real instructor. He kept going on<lf>and on about "being ready to thrash!"
<string>And it seems Elder Fugen may have<lf>had a hand in it as well. Although I was<lf>told to keep that part a secret. Hehehe.
<string>I suspect they've been racking their<lf>brains to think of a way to help your<lf>hunting career. How sweet!
<string>I've added Utsushi's request to the quest<lf>list. Accept it whenever you're ready! But<lf>make sure you ARE ready first, OK?
<string><CAM:0,1,2,3,4>When you are, just head through<lf>the <COLS RED>Quest Gate</COL> to begin.
<string><RCAM:0.5>Now, let's dive into the quest list!
<string>Oh sweet heavens...<lf>Bunny Dango are an absolute taste<lf>of paradise!
<string>Hey and welcome back! How'd everything<lf>go with Master Utsushi's quest?
<string>I know, I know... The basics are, well, basic.<lf>But you gotta have a sturdy foundation<lf>before you can build, right?
<string>Take Bunny Dango, for example. Yomogi<lf>puts as much effort into selecting ingredients<lf>as she does preparing them!
<string>Hehe! Anyway, I know you're not here to talk<lf>dango. You're here to talk quests! And lucky<lf>for you, I've got some <COLS RED>1★</COL> quests ready to go!
<string>You know, questing is kinda like climbing<lf>a mountain. Keep completing them and,<lf>before you know it, you'll be at the top!
<string>And just like a mountain, there's more<lf>than one way to the top! Pick the quests<lf>right for you and forge your own path!
<string>But you're gonna stay right here and listen<lf>to me blabber about Bunny Dango if you<lf>don't hurry up and pick a quest! Hehe!
<string>This is real bad!
<string><PL>!<lf>An urgent quest has just been issued!
<string>Urgent quests need to be taken care of ASAP!<lf>And if you don't, things can get bad, like REAL<lf>bad! And right now, things are looking grim!
<string>Yomogi ran over and told me that<lf>a <COLS RED>Great Izuchi</COL> is blocking an important<lf>trade route near the Shrine Ruins.
<string><VO:SER>And it's not any old trade route.<lf>It's the one merchants use to bring<lf>the ingredients for Bunny Dango!
<string>Oh no... We might actually run out<lf>of Bunny Dango! I feel faint. You've<lf>gotta get rid of that monster!
<string>But be careful, Great Izuchi usually have<lf>a band of mini Izuchi in tow. They can<lf>gang up on you if you don't watch out!
<string>OK, get out there and save our dango!
<string>They're safe!<lf>The Bunny Dango are safe!
<string>Welcome back! That Great Izuchi<lf>has been hunted and the ingredients<lf>have been delivered safely!
<string>Yomogi is back to her usual routine<lf>and I am no longer in panic mode!<lf>Crisis averted!
<string>And now, as a reward for<lf>the Defender of the Dango,<lf>you can take on <COLS RED>2★</COL> quests!
<string>You're on your way to the top, but you're<lf>not out of the woods yet! More dangerous<lf>threats await, so make sure to prepare well.
<string>Poor Iori...
<string>Right on time, the urgent quest<lf>is ready to go!
<string>Today's hunt is for <COLS RED>Aknosom</COL>!
<string>This monster has a peculiar attack<lf>where it fans out the crest on its<lf>head before charging. Scary stuff!
<string>Monsters can be tricky, so pay close<lf>attention to their behavior if you want<lf>to make it back in one piece!
<string>What a relief...
<string>Oh, hey, <PL>! Thanks to<lf>you, Iori's Buddies made it back safely.<lf>You're such a big help!
<string>Master Hamon is relieved as well. When<lf>he got word that Iori's Buddies were safe,<lf>he had the biggest grin on his face.
<string>Speaking of, I think I've got some news<lf>that'll hopefully put a smile on your face!<lf>You've unlocked <COLS RED>3★</COL> quests!
<string>And not only do you get new quests, but<lf>you get to travel to a new locale too!<lf>Make sure you prepare accordingly, OK?
<string>It's here...
<string>It's finally here. We have an urgent<lf>quest to stop the Rampage.
<string>I've been enlisted as a defender.<lf>I can't wait! Don't get all jealous if<lf>I do a better job than you, OK?
<string>Are you up for it?
<string>Magnamalo, ugh...
<string>Oh, hey, <PL>!<lf>You're gonna have your hands full<lf>juggling Magnamalo AND the Rampage...
<string>But with Kamura Village united, we<lf>can do anything. There is always<lf>a dawn even after the darkest night.
<string>As of right now, we don't have any<lf>information on Magnamalo's location.<lf>We should tread carefully...
<string>There are still some 3★ quests to take<lf>care of. How about you knock those<lf>out in the meantime?
<string>Ugh... What a headache.
<string>Oh, <PL>!<lf>An urgent quest has come in!
<string>It's a request to hunt down a <COLS RED>Bishaten</COL>,<lf>a BIG monster with a BIG tail that likes<lf>to monkey around.
<string>Most of that monkeying around<lf>involves attacks using its tail,<lf>so keep an eye on it, OK? OK!
<string>That was bananas!
<string>Good job out there! Oh, by the way, have<lf>you noticed how excited Elder Fugen and<lf>Master Hamon have been acting recently?
<string>My sister says that Master Hojo in the<lf>Gathering Hub has been in a super good<lf>mood too! He's croaking in delight!
<string>All three used to be famous hunters back<lf>in their day and now they're reliving their<lf>glory days vicariously through you. Hehe.
<string>I wonder if they remember doing <COLS RED>4★</COL> quests...<lf>Well, I'm sure it'll all come back to them<lf>soon enough now that you've unlocked them!
<string>And that's not all you've unlocked! More<lf>stars equals tougher monsters, but I'm<lf>sure you'll be just fine! Hehehe.
<string>Good luck, <PL>!
<string><VO:SER>We all knew it was coming and finally<lf>it's here! I just received the urgent<lf>quest to hunt down Magnamalo.
<string>Everyone in the village will fend<lf>off the Rampage. We'll make<lf>sure nothing gets in your way.
<string>It doesn't matter where you are or what<lf>monster you're fighting, the spirit<lf>of Kamura is with you. Always.
<string><VO:NOR>Whew! All this serious talk has really<lf>got my tummy rumbling!
<string>When all of this is over, let's celebrate with<lf>a monster-sized pile of Bunny Dango!<lf>My mouth is watering just thinking about it!
<string><PL>, th-that sword!?
<string>Is it true!? Can it be!? You've really<lf>inherited Elder Fugen's sword!?
<string>It IS true! What an honor to be able<lf>to receive such a mythical weapon!
<string>Hmm? What will happen now that such<lf>a treasure has been bestowed upon you?
<string>Umm... I don't think anything particular will<lf>happen. Do you, uh, feel incredible power<lf>coursing through your very being!? No?
<string>Oh well... Elder Fugen did mention that<lf>he wanted to pass it on in the near future<lf>because it was super heavy. That's weird—
<string>OOOOOH! Maybe he meant heavy as in<lf>the weight of responsibility it carries. Not<lf>physical weight. It all makes sense now.
<string>See, for us in the village, the sword is<lf>a powerful symbol that is only held by a<lf>true leader! Are you ready to be a leader!?
<string>Are you ready to take on that responsibility!?<lf>We'll see. For now, you'll have to settle for<lf>taking on these <COLS RED>5★</COL> quests! Hehehe!
<string>Yikes! This is gonna get messy...!
<string>Oh, <PL>!<lf>I've been waiting for you! An urgent<lf>quest has just come in.
<string>This time you're up against an <COLS RED>Almudron</COL>.<lf>This monster is a REAL stick in the mud<lf>and loves to fight dirty... Literally!
<string>But, I know you're no stranger to getting<lf>your hands dirty. So get out there and<lf>win this mudslinging contest!
<string>Hey, <PL>!<lf>You sure mopped the floor with<lf>that monster!
<string>Thanks again for taking care of that<lf>urgent quest, and with such...urgency!
<string>Not to mention you saved a bunch of<lf>villagers a trip to the cleaners! I can<lf>recommend a good place, by the way.
<string>Anyway, I know Elder Fugen already told<lf>you, but I'm obligated to repeat it: You<lf>are now able to take on <COLS RED>6★</COL> quests!
<string>There are so many great quests here<lf>perfect for a formidable warrior like<lf>yourself. Hunt all the monsters!
<string>Or take a bath. Either way, I'll be<lf>waiting here for my order of Bunny<lf>Dango to arrive.
<string>But before I start stuffing my face,<lf>care to have a look at the quest list?
<string><NOFAC>It's been a long time since we went<lf>shopping together!
<string><NOFAC>Ahhh, the weather is so nice today...
<string><NOFAC>Bunny~Dango~♪ Bunny~Dango~♪
<string><NOFAC>Every day should start with<lf>Bunny Dango!
<string><NOFAC>Yomogi's Bunny Dango are a<lf>true taste of heaven. I cannot wait!
<string>Well, <PL>.<lf>Let's get started with the basic training<lf>quest that Utsushi has set up for you.
<string>I wonder what he has in store for you.<lf>Well, don't just go charging in! Make<lf>sure you're fully prepared first!
<string>Wow, <PL>!<lf>Looks like you completed that basic<lf>training quest with no problems!
<string>Elder Fugen is expecting the good news.<lf>Why don't you go and do the honors?
<string>Good news, <PL>!<lf>Now that you've finished basic training,<lf>you can take on 1★ quests!
<string>You may just be starting out,<lf>but you're on your way!
<string>Just keep a good pace, and before<lf>you know it, you'll be a monster<lf>hunter extraordinaire!
<string>I wonder what kind of Hunter you're<lf>going to turn out to be. I absolutely<lf>cannot wait to find out!
<string>Yomogi has been looking for you,<lf><PL>!
<string>Go over to the Tea Shop ASAP!
<string><PL>!<lf>It's an urgent quest! You need to<lf>hunt down that Great Izuchi.
<string>If you don't, then those ingredients<lf>for Bunny Dango will never<lf>be delivered!
<string>And without Bunny Dango, my body<lf>will weaken and I will fade into nothingness.<lf>Yours is a mission of mercy!
<string>Welcome back,<lf><PL>.
<string>Good work with that urgent quest.<lf>Elder Fugen is waiting to hear your<lf>good news.
<string>I was so scared when Yomogi said we<lf>might run out of dango... It's been<lf>the most terrifying time of my life.
<string>But because of you, I can get back<lf>to my daily routine of stuffing my<lf>face with dango without fear.
<string>You saved my life! That's no<lf>exaggeration. I don't know<lf>how I can ever repay you.
<string>Hey, <PL>!<lf>Iori has been looking for you.<lf>Something very urgent has come up!
<string>Iori rarely asks for help with anything,<lf>so it's kinda strange he's asking now.<lf>But this is not your average situation.
<string>Just goes to show how much trust<lf>you've earned around here. Now,<lf>don't keep him waiting!
<string>Hey, <PL>!<lf>As you've heard from Iori, you have<lf>an urgent quest to hunt an Aknosom.
<string>I know Iori must be worried sick<lf>about those Buddies. I can hardly<lf>imagine how he feels! Anyway...
<string>While you keep the monster occupied,<lf>Iori will look for, and hopefully, bring home<lf>those Buddies! Now, don't keep him waiting!
<string>Welcome back, <PL>.<lf>Elder Fugen said he wanted a word<lf>with you.
<string><VO:SER>Maybe you've heard about Master Hamon<lf>and his grandson, Iori's complicated<lf>relationship.
<string>Master Hamon was disappointed that<lf>Iori chose to be a Buddy Handler,<lf>because it's a "sign of weakness."
<string>But the truth is, Master Hamon is just bad<lf>with Canynes. Not to mention stubborn. But<lf>he loves Iori and wants only the best for him.
<string>But the situation has stagnated<lf>so long that they both feel really<lf>awkward talking about.
<string>The Rampage is finally here...<lf>I'll be defending the perimeter<lf>around the Stronghold.
<string>You'll be defending inside the Stronghold.<lf>It's a shame you won't get to check out<lf>this lass loosing arrows like crazy...
<string>Well, off I go. Good luck to<lf>you in there. I'll see you<lf>after it's all over, OK?
<string><PL>! It's good to see<lf>you. Sounds like things got hairy inside<lf>the Stronghold! I'm glad you made it out.
<string>I think Elder Fugen wants<lf>to talk to you about what<lf>went down.
<string>Iori and Yomogi have been asking if<lf>there's another way to protect the<lf>village that doesn't involve hunting.
<string>Hehehe! I wanted to tell them the answer,<lf>but Elder Fugen would be so mad at me if<lf>I outright told them.
<string>I tried to give them a little hint by saying,<lf>"Well, my contribution involves sitting<lf>here and eating lots of Bunny Dango."
<string>But I think I ended up confusing them<lf>even more. Hehehehe!
<string>That reminds me, Master Hamon<lf>said he has something he wants<lf>to talk to you about.
<string>It looked like he was plotting<lf>something. Why don't you go and find<lf>out what it is?
<string>When Master Hamon was a hunter,<lf>he failed to stop Magnamalo and<lf>it's been eating at him ever since.
<string>Now that he's a smithy, he's trying<lf>to atone for his failings as a hunter<lf>with whatever it is he's been making.
<string>I guess we'll see how it plays out, but in the<lf>meantime, you have a Bishaten to take care<lf>of. Don't forget what I said about its tail now.
<string>Hey, <PL>! Welcome back.<lf>And nice work hunting that Bishaten!
<string>Elder Fugen is waiting for you.<lf>You should go and let him know<lf>you're back.
<string>Hey, <PL>! Ready to give<lf>Magnamalo a big welcome, Kamura-style?<lf>I know the whole village is raring to go!
<string>Elder Fugen, and Masters Hamon and<lf>Hojo are especially pumped. I guess<lf>you remind them of themselves. Hehehe!
<string>They were talking about hunting<lf>again. They even came to Minoto<lf>and me with their plan!
<string>It's time, <PL>!<lf>This is the big fight with Magnamalo.<lf>Just you two, one-on-one.
<string>It may have been separated from the Rampage,<lf>but that doesn't make it any less dangerous.<lf>Stay sharp out there!
<string>Now before you go, let's hit up the Tea Shop<lf>and eat! You can't go out and fight an epic<lf>battle on an empty stomach!
<string>Although Magnamalo is no more, there<lf>are still plenty of other monsters that<lf>need your attention.
<string>Not to mention that the threat of the Rampage<lf>still looms. Sorry, <PL>, it looks like<lf>you've got your work cut out for you.
<string>And me as well! But at least I've got<lf>Yomogi's delicious Bunny Dango<lf>to get me through. Hehehe!
<string>I can't believe that an Almudron has<lf>emerged from its mountain exile.<lf>Things are about to get messy...
<string>Now, don't let Almudron's appearance fool you,<lf>it's hardly some decrepit push-over. They fight<lf>dirty and are quick to cart a hunter!
<string>Before you go clean shop, make sure<lf>you're well-prepared. And by that, I mean<lf>filling up on Bunny Dango of course!
<string>You've really made a name<lf>for yourself at the Guild<lf>with all of your exploits.
<string>I don't think it'll be long before<lf>some other town or village tries<lf>to lure you away.
<string>Your career is only just starting.<lf>There are valuable experiences to<lf>be found outside of the village.
<string>I'll be happy for you, of course.<lf>But... *sniff*
<string>Just thinking about it makes me want<lf>to cry.
<string>Have you had a chance to speak to Minoto<lf>in the Gathering Hub?
<string>She's the super-serious type, you know?<lf>Always does things by the book. She can<lf>be a real pain sometimes...
<string>But I can't really fault her for it.<lf>She's on top of everything, so the<lf>Gathering Hub runs like clockwork.
<string>Me, on the other hand, I'm just bumbling<lf>along, trying not to get sauce on the quests.<lf>Apologies in advance if yours are sticky...
<string>Looks like there's a Rampage quest<lf>waiting for you in the Gathering Hub.<lf>But it's not just you going out to fight.
<string>Any villager who can handle a weapon<lf>must take up arms. I'll be going too. But<lf>don't you worry about me; I've got my bow.
<string>As for you, you'll be stationed inside the<lf>Stronghold while we defend the perimeter.<lf>But first a dango, then it's off to work!
<string>The Rampage has kept everyone at the Guild<lf>scratching their head for the longest but<lf>its cause remains a complete mystery...
<string>Master Hojo and the villagers have been trying<lf>to figure it out ever since I can remember.<lf>I hope they can before it's too late.
<string>Hey, <PL>! Minoto told me<lf>you kicked some monster's tail. Not<lf>in those words, of course. Hehehe!
<string>And, uh, what's this about the monster<lf>looking like Master Hojo? Was it slimy<lf>and scaly or something? Oh, it was!
<string>Slimy and scaly, huh...?<lf>Was it a Mizutsune?
<string>Sometimes it feels so quiet here. Quiet<lf>enough to make me briefly forget about<lf>the Rampage and the calamity it'll bring...
<string>But you're making a lot of noise at the Hub<lf>from what I hear. Minoto tells me Master<lf>Hojo is very pleased with your work!
<string>Hearing praise for you is like hearing<lf>praise for myself. And a job well-done<lf>deserves a treat. A delicious one!
<string><VO:SER>It looks like a Rampage quest just came<lf>in at the Gathering Hub. I'll be heading<lf>out with everyone shortly...
<string><PL>...<lf>There's no telling what may happen<lf>to the village if we fail...
<string>I'm trying not to jinx our mission, but<lf>I'm freaking out here a little. Maybe<lf>something sweet will calm me down.
<string>I'm sorry, I suddenly let myself spiral.<lf>I need to keep myself together.<lf>Bet you didn't expect that...
<string>I'm used to resonating with Minoto,<lf>but this was the first time with a<lf>monster. It was too much to handle...
<string>But please don't worry about me. These<lf>Bunny Dango have perked me right<lf>up and I'm back to my usual self!
<string><VO:SER>Minoto is really beating herself up over<lf>this whole ordeal. She keeps blaming<lf>herself for not being able to help me.
<string>I keep trying to tell her...
<string>Tell her that I'm so proud of her, and<lf>that I love her so much. But she<lf>doesn't seem to believe me.
<string>She feels like the worst sister ever for<lf>not being able to help me and I feel the<lf>same because I can't help HER. UGH!
<string>She barely ever smiles these days.<lf>I have to do something, but I don't<lf>know what will make it better.
<string>I see that you finally made it to<lf>the top of that monster hunting<lf>mountain! Hehehe!
<string>I was so busy worrying about monsters,<lf>I forgot to congratulate you, so...<lf>CONGRATULATIONS!
<string>Now, just because you've climbed to the<lf>top of one mountain doesn't mean there<lf>aren't others to conquer! Make me proud!
<string><VO:SER>Everyone believed that The Rampage<lf>was just a horde of monsters attacking<lf>the village randomly.
<string>But in reality, it was all triggered by<lf>Wind Serpent Ibushi's presence.
<string>If we can eliminate Ibushi, then Kamura<lf>will be free of this nightmare. I know we<lf>can do it! I don't want to think otherwise.
<string><PL>, it's finally time!<lf>Time to take on Wind Serpent Ibushi!
<string><PL>...<lf>If you can defeat Ibushi once and<lf>for all, I'll be free from its power!
<string>You can't lose! Just think of Yomogi's<lf>Tea Shop! What will she do without her<lf>biggest customer!? Hehehe...
<string>You freed me from Ibushi's grip!
<string>I feel amazing! ...And like I could eat<lf>my weight in Bunny Dango! I don't<lf>know how I'll ever thank you!
<string>However, Elder Fugen warned us that<lf>the Rampage is still a threat, so our<lf>work is not done yet!
<string><VO:SER>Minoto is acting strange. I tried<lf>resonating with her, but it didn't work...
<string>My gut feeling is not giving<lf>me a good sign here. Please<lf>be careful out there...
<string><VO:SER>When I resonated with Ibushi, it had only<lf>one thought repeating over and over:<lf>"Where is my queen? Where is my queen?"
<string>Was it seeking out the other<lf>one...? The one my sister<lf>resonated with, Narwa?
<string>At least I can resonate with<lf>her again. But she's also<lf>connected to that thing too.
<string>And it hurts me so much because,<lf>when she's connected to it...<lf>It's...it's like she enjoys it!
<string>This is the big showdown with<lf>Thunder Serpent Narwa.
<string>I remember when we went shopping,<lf>that day you became a hunter.
<string>Look at you now! At the peak of your<lf>career! You've saved the village and<lf>taken on the source of the Rampage.
<string>It fills me with so much pride. You have<lf>become such a brilliant flame, lighting<lf>the way for Kamura Village.
<string>Please be careful on your journey.<lf>I will be waiting for your return<lf>right here in this tranquil village.
<string>After Minoto and I resonated with the serpents,<lf>the location where Ibushi and Narwa were<lf>hiding became clear as day to us...
<string>This calamity may continue yet,<lf>but as long as you're here, we<lf>have nothing to fear.
<string>You're just like a Bunny Dango,<lf>you know? Hehe. You put a smile<lf>on my face and fill me with joy.
<string><VO:SER>Ibushi and Narwa are together again and<lf>planning to make the world a permanent<lf>habitat for generations of their kind...
<string>I-It's a pretty grim situation. But you've<lf>saved the village countless times before,<lf>so this'll be a cinch for you. Yeah...!
<string>*sigh* I'm doing my best to stay positive,<lf>but my body wont stop trembling. I just<lf>can't stop worrying about you!
<string><VO:NOR>Sorry, but that means it's up to you to<lf>put me at ease. So hurry up and save<lf>the village already. Please? Hehehe.
<string>From the cerulean heavens above to<lf>the verdant fields below...all of Kamura<lf>Village can finally know true peace.
<string>And it's all thanks to you! Look at me,<lf>babbling on and getting all choked up!<lf>That's just how amazing you are!
<string>"...<PL>, the Savior of Kamura."<lf>Has a nice ring to it, huh? I wonder what's<lf>next for you after a grand feat like that?
<string>Hehe, I can't wait to find out!
<string>Now that Kamura is back to its old, vibrant<lf>self, it's like even the Bunny Dango taste<lf>more...tasty or something. Weird, huh?
<string>I could demolish TWO super-duper<lf>dango orders in one bite—easily!
<string>And a couple more from<lf>your plate too! Hehe!
<string>Everyone loves dango. But did you<lf>know that Yomogi revolutionized<lf>everything we know about dango?
<string>Not just how they look, but how<lf>they're made, how they taste. Even<lf>the concept of what they actually are!
<string>I think they'd be crazy-popular if she sold<lf>them outside of the village, but she only<lf>wants to make them for the villagers.
<string>I guess I shouldn't complain! There's no way<lf>she'd have time to make my gigantic order if<lf>she had to tend to so many customers.
<string>Hey, <PL>! Do you know<lf>what Kamura Village is most famous<lf>for? Obviously, there's our Tatara Steel.
<string>But also the beautiful scenery. And, lots<lf>of delicious food, like Bunny Dango,<lf>to enjoy while taking in the view.
<string>However, the Rampage has caused tourist<lf>numbers to dwindle, so I've come up with<lf>a way to draw people here again.
<string>But I can only do that once the Rampage<lf>is over. If we can protect the village's<lf>reputation, they'll soon come back.
<string>Elder Fugen; Master Hamon, the Blacksmith;<lf>and Guild Master Hojo, were all renowned<lf>hunters back in their day.
<string>Elder Fugen used a long sword; Master Hamon,<lf>a light bowgun; and Master Hojo... Well, his<lf>weapon of choice is a total mystery.
<string>I heard that it was super strong, but<lf>neither Elder Fugen or Master Hamon<lf>would tell me what it was.
<string>Minoto snuck a look at Master Hojo's old<lf>records and it said something about...<lf>"Tetsucabra-style." He didn't really use a—?
<string>Nevermind, there's enough mysteries<lf>around here for me to be worrying about<lf>this one too. Ugh...
<string>If you ever need some smithing done,<lf>there's no one better than Master Hamon,<lf>our resident smithy.
<string>He's the one that came up with the<lf>Toadversary in the Training Area. He<lf>truly is a very talented artisan!
<string>But he only seems interested in<lf>making things good for hunting...
<string>I once asked him if he could come up<lf>with something that would help us mass-<lf>produce dango and he just...scoffed!
<string>Did you know that Minoto and I wanted<lf>to be hunters, too? We thought about<lf>applying to the Guild and everything!
<string>I'm a master archer and Minoto is<lf>a pro with a lance. Elder Fugen<lf>even said we had a solid chance.
<string>But the problem is, I get SO hungry. I'm<lf>out of rations before I leave basecamp. And<lf>Minoto, well, she just hates going outside.
<string>So, we gave up... But after seeing you<lf>have all that fun out on hunts, we've<lf>been getting the itch again!
<string>I'm so tempted to go, but then I'm<lf>reminded that the Tea Shop doesn't<lf>deliver out in the field...
<string>People always worry about me. They<lf>think all I eat is dango. And I do eat<lf>a lot. I mean A LOT of Bunny Dango.
<string>But, don't you worry! Minoto makes<lf>three delicious, well-balanced meals<lf>for me.
<string>The Bunny Dango are just bonus<lf>snacks. And they're super good for<lf>you, so no need to worry about me!
<string>I mean, come on! This job requires a lot<lf>of energy. It's hard work doing what I do!<lf>Phew! Already worked up an appetite!
