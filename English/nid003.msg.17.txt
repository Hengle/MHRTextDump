<string>英語メッセージ
<string>Welcome to my shop.
<string><NOFAC><CAM:0>Greetings, Master <PL>.<lf>I was just informed that you have been<lf>accepted into the Guild. Felicitations.
<string>Here you will find restorative<lf>cures and other such items<lf>to aid you on your hunts.
<string>I often diversify my stock and provide<lf>special offers for hunters, too. I think<lf>you'll find them most agreeable.
<string><NPC:35>Kagero sometimes offers items<lf>at half-price, and that's when you<lf>can pick up some real bargains.
<string>I always hold off on buying what I want<lf>until the sale—and when it's on,<lf>I swoop in like a Rathian on the trail!
<string><NPC:3>I have often sensed Lady Hinoa's<lf>sharp gaze upon my back. Now,<lf>I know why...
<string><NPC:35>Anyway, Kagero, about those<lf>items I asked you to set aside<lf>for me—
<string><NPC:3>Of course. I'll have them<lf>packaged and sent to you<lf>at your convenience.
<string><NPC:35><VO:SP1>Then that's a wrap! Let's see,<lf>where should we go next...?
<string><CAM:1><VO:NOR>"Steadfast as Steel"<lf>Master <COLS RED>Hamon the Blacksmith</COL>!<lf>It'd be nice to pay him a visit.
<string><NOFAC>Only when you have been formally<lf>recognized by Guild Master Hojo<lf>are you officially a hunter, correct?
<string>I shall await your visit after you're<lf>fully officiated. I'm sure my wares<lf>will prove useful on your quests.
<string>I've traveled far and wide, but it was<lf>here, with the help of Elder Fugen and<lf>Master Hojo, that I began my trade.
<string>I had suffered much, and came to this<lf>village a nameless drifter... It was they<lf>who then taught me merchanting.
<string>Thanks to them, I have been reborn<lf>into a better, more fulfilling life.
<string>Should another Rampage be nigh,<lf>I shall honor that debt in doing<lf>what I can to aid Kamura Village.
<string>Master <PL>,<lf>I hear you're ready to take on 1★ quests.<lf>So, the real hunt begins.
<string>Remember: Skill, experience, and good<lf>equipment are paramount. Even more<lf>so if you hope to face the Rampage.
<string>You mustn't forget to stock up<lf>on items. I have plenty that<lf>you're sure to find helpful...
<string><VO:SER>Lady Yomogi, seems upset by something.
<string>Her smile always brightens the whole<lf>village; this melancholy is as if a dark<lf>cloud hangs over us all...
<string>Master <PL>,<lf>I do hope you might find<lf>the time to help her.
<string>The merchant who was inconvenienced<lf>at the Shrine Ruins is an...associate<lf>of mine.
<string>He says he sensed a strange<lf>stirring there, different to that<lf>of the Rampage, somehow.
<string>Another threat may be brewing<lf>under the chaos of the Rampage.<lf>Take care, Master <PL>...
<string>It is heartening to see every villager<lf>prepare for the imminent calamity<lf>with such fire and resolve.
<string>Most striking is the aptitude for<lf>combat that many younger villagers<lf>who are not hunters have shown.
<string>Of particular note are Lady Hinoa,<lf>Lady Minoto, Lady Yomogi, and<lf>Master Iori.
<string>Although, perhaps, in a culture<lf>founded on steel like Kamura's,<lf>it is only natural after all.
<string><VO:SER>With the Rampage upon us, we must<lf>all do our part. It's not much, but I shall<lf>supply goods to the Stronghold.
<string>To fear that we may lose our home<lf>is terrible. To sit by and allow that<lf>fear to be my last, well...
<string><VO:NOR>...Hah. Please, forgive my idle chatter.<lf>Our foremost priority is the village's<lf>safety. Let's make for the Stronghold.
<string>A disturbance different to that<lf>of the Rampage... Now we know<lf>it must have been Magnamalo...
<string>Well, that and you, Lady Yomogi,<lf>and Master Iori are unhurt. Truly,<lf>I am overjoyed you three were safe.
<string>Magnamalo feeds on the Rampage and<lf>thus grows stronger. When it appeared<lf>before you, it looked quite full.
<string>Retreating was the smart move.<lf>Magnamalo at full strength would<lf>have been difficult to defeat...
<string>To challenge Magnamalo amongst<lf>the Rampage would be folly. If you had<lf>some sort of device to lure it away...
<string>My, I'd expect no less speed and<lf>precision from Master Hamon,<lf>yet I'm impressed all the same.
<string>Now we wait for Magnamalo to show<lf>itself and you, Master <PL>,<lf>to hunt it down. It won't be long...
<string>I hear Magnamalo has shown itself.<lf>This will be one of your toughest hunts.<lf>Make sure you stock up on items...
<string>They say it was Magnamalo that<lf>destroyed Kamura in the previous<lf>calamity, half a century ago.
<string>Elder Fugen, Master Hamon, and<lf>Master Hojo failed to best it, though<lf>they were in their prime...
<string>Lady Yomogi has been rather<lf>chipper as of late. Come to<lf>think of it, so has Master Iori...
<string>Perhaps they've discovered a way<lf>that they can help protect Kamura.
<string>I shall follow their lead, and devote<lf>myself to merchanting for the sake<lf>of my beloved second home...
<string>Master <PL>, your aura<lf>has changed. There is a certain<lf>authority about you, as of late.
<string>And yet, I see no intimidation,<lf>only kindness, in your eyes...
<string>That is what makes a fierce hunter:<lf>Not only the strength to hunt,<lf>but also the compassion to aid.
<string>I hope that you will continue to use<lf>those qualities to protect Kamura.<lf>I could not bear to lose my home...
<string>Master <PL>, it<lf>appears that there are now quests<lf>available for you at the Gathering Hub.
<string>I've heard that Maido, the resident<lf>merchant there, is quite persuasive.<lf>I could learn from her, I'm sure...
<string>With the Hub at the center of<lf>your activities now, I'm sure hers<lf>will be a shop of convenience.
<string>Nonetheless, I hope you'll still<lf>visit this establishment every<lf>now and then.
<string>Master, <PL>. A Rampage<lf>Quest has been issued and you are<lf>being summoned to the Gathering Hub.
<string>I'll be supplying the Stronghold<lf>with whatever you may need.<lf>Do take a look at my wares there...
<string>Master <PL>, that was<lf>one for the ages, indeed. The whole village<lf>was positively enraptured watching.
<string><VO:SER>Even so, we have not truly<lf>bested the Rampage until<lf>we know its cause.
<string>Otherwise, we risk its return<lf>mere decades from now.
<string>That's why I'd like to see the calamity<lf>ended once and for all. The villagers<lf>should never have to suffer it again.
<string>It appears your 2★ quests at<lf>the Gathering Hub are going well...
<string>Expect your hunts to only get tougher.<lf>Don't neglect to check your items,<lf>weapons, and meals.
<string>Adjust each according to the conditions<lf>of your quests. Remember, even a single<lf>item can turn the tide of battle!
<string>Master <PL>, I've heard<lf>much of your successes with the Gathering<lf>Hub quests. It comes as no surprise to me.
<string>Master Hojo, however, is<lf>unusually quiet and restless<lf>when you are away to hunt.
<string>He's likely been so worried<lf>about you, the anxiety's taken<lf>the wind right out of his sails...
<string><VO:SER>It appears this Rampage has produced<lf>something of a leader for the horde.
<string>This Apex monster concerns me, but<lf>what I find far more troubling is<lf>Lady Hinoa's strangely somber tenor...
<string><VO:SER>What a price we have paid<lf>to stave off the calamity...
<string>While relieving to see Lady Hinoa<lf>regain her usual cheer, we can afford<lf>neither delay nor complacency now.
<string>We don't know if, or when, the serpent<lf>may resonate with her again... We<lf>must somehow discover its identity.
<string><VO:SER>This azure fiend appeared around<lf>the same time the Rampage did...
<string>But, as far as we know,<lf>its connection to the Rampage's<lf>horde is far from absolute.
<string>It doesn't join in their attack, but<lf>simply circles the skies. With what<lf>Lady Hinoa said, it must be waiting...
<string><VO:SER>For so long, Kamura has suffered<lf>the Rampage and never known why.
<string>Master <PL>, thanks to<lf>your efforts, those days may<lf>have finally come to an end...
<string>The Wind Serpent Ibushi...<lf>It was this creature driving<lf>the mass migration all along.
<string>To think we didn't even know of<lf>its existence until now is flooring.<lf>Just when we thought we'd seen it all...
<string>Master <PL>, your<lf>battle with Ibushi was a marvel to behold.<lf>I was overcome with awe, myself.
<string>While you may feel chagrin that you<lf>couldn't fell it entirely, rest assured,<lf>the wounds you dealt it were deadly.
<string>But, as Elder Fugen said, the Rampage<lf>remains unaffected. And then there is<lf>this queen Lady Hinoa spoke of...
<string>Take care, lest you become<lf>the hunted.
<string><VO:SER>So, with raging winds come<lf>raging thunder. That was what<lf>she meant by "queen..."
<string>Then the war is not yet won:<lf>Unless both are defeated,<lf>the Rampage will never end.
<string>I only hope Lady Minoto has not<lf>suffered too greatly to this end,<lf>as Lady Hinoa did with Ibushi...
<string><VO:SER>Despite your best efforts,<lf>Ibushi and Narwa still live...<lf>This really is most concerning.
<string>Should they convene, who knows what<lf>manner of catastrophe may befall us.<lf>They might even bring the end times...
<string>I have faith in you and I pray<lf>that it will never come to that.
<string>I must admit, <PL>, there<lf>have been moments when I have seen some<lf>parallels between my younger self and you.
<string>I forsook my home when it needed me<lf>most, and lost it...but you—you've stood<lf>firm to save yours no matter what.
<string>Narwa and Ibushi are both formidable,<lf>but I trust that your conviction will<lf>triumph over their strength... Good luck.
<string>With the calamity felled by your hand,<lf>and the Rampage nearing its end,<lf>the village finally seems revitalized.
<string>Words cannot express the joyful<lf>gratitude I bear for you having<lf>saved my beloved second home.
<string>May Kamura be free from peril<lf>and resplendent with peace<lf>forevermore...
<string>Greetings, Master <PL>.<lf>You are as prolific in your<lf>endeavors as ever, I see.
<string>Though the Rampage nears its<lf>end, such is never the case for<lf>a hunter's need of items.
<string>As always, I often vary my inventory with<lf>wares you'll certainly find useful, so do<lf>take a look at them when it so pleases you...
<string>As ridiculous as it is,<lf>ladies often request that I remove<lf>this cloth and show them my face.
<string>A little birdie once told me that<lf>it's because they think I'm a...<lf>A "hottie," I think it was.
<string>I am flattered to receive such...<lf>colorful and earnest praise,<lf>but I'm sadly unable to oblige.
<string>This cloth must never be removed,<lf>no matter the circumstance... But,<lf>in any case, it's not hiding much.
<string>Master <PL>, have you<lf>met with the trader at the Buddy Plaza?<lf>She has quite the unusual name, "Rondayne."
<string>I'm told she hails from a distant<lf>land, with many a rarity to trade<lf>in tow...
<string>...No, it can't be. Can it? Has a worthy<lf>opponent in the mercantile arts<lf>finally appeared to challenge me?
<string>Masterful work dispatching the Aknosom,<lf>Master <PL>.
<string>This very umbrella of mine is<lf>made from Aknosom, in fact,<lf>hence its uniquely vibrant hue.
<string>Hamon made it especially for me, so<lf>that it even doubles as a defensive item.<lf>It is my most treasured possession...
<string>By the by, I was finally able to meet<lf>this Lady "Rondayne" face-to-cloth.
<string>At first I thought her a potential<lf>merchanting competitor, but it turns<lf>out her only business is in bartering.
<string>My fears would be entirely allayed<lf>if not for the fact that she is clearly<lf>no mere merchant... Who is she really?
<string>When I happened upon this village,<lf>I was in critical condition. I had<lf>suffered many wounds, some mortal.
<string>It was the doctor here, Master Zenchi,<lf>who saved my life. Unreliable as he may<lf>seem, he possesses incredible talent.
<string>Since then, we have formed a friendship<lf>of sorts. He even comes to lend me<lf>a helping hand when I have sales.
<string>I owe him both my health and<lf>my happiness. I only hope that<lf>one day I can repay him in kind...
<string>Lady Yomogi's Bunny Dango<lf>are truly a flavorful delight.
<string>Lady Hinoa did not exaggerate<lf>in saying that they fulfill the body<lf>and soul. What an amazing fare.
<string>Perhaps it's Lady Yomogi's love<lf>for her craft that makes them so—
<string>*snicker* I ought to be more...<lf>conservative with flattery.
<string>Might you spare a moment?
<string><NOFAC>You've found a sub-camp location in<lf>the Shrine Ruins, yes? Elder Fugen has<lf>asked me to help set the camp up.
<string>To be able do so, may I request your<lf>aid in securing the surrounding area?
<string>Having that sub-camp should also<lf>assist in furthering your expeditions.
<string>Think of it as a..."mutually<lf>beneficial agreement" of sorts.
<string>Astounding work, as always.
<string><NOFAC>Thank you for securing the area.<lf>Now we may begin setting up camp.
<string>Once finished, it will be available<lf>for you to use as a new base<lf>of operations, if you so wish.
<string>It should be ready for you before<lf>you embark on your next quest.
<string>Might you spare a moment?
<string><NOFAC>You've found a sub-camp location in<lf>the Frost Islands, yes? Elder Fugen has<lf>asked me to help set the camp up.
<string>I had hoped to begin right away, but...<lf>Some nearby monsters have caused a delay.<lf>Might I ask you to subdue them?
<string>Having that sub-camp should also<lf>assist in furthering your expeditions.
<string>Think of it as a...<lf>"quid pro quo," as they say.
<string>Astounding work, as always.
<string><NOFAC>Thank you for hunting those beasts.<lf>Now we may begin setting up camp.
<string>Once finished, it will be available<lf>for you to use as a new base<lf>of operations, if you so wish.
<string>It should be ready for you before<lf>you embark on your next quest.
<string>Might you spare a moment?
<string><NOFAC>You've found a sub-camp location in<lf>the Frost Islands, yes? Elder Fugen has<lf>asked me to help set the camp up.
<string>I had hoped to begin right away, but...<lf>We lack the construction materials.<lf>Could I ask you to obtain them for us?
<string>Given how chilly the location will<lf>be, warm materials would be best.
<string>Having that sub-camp should also<lf>assist in furthering your expeditions.
<string>Astounding work, as always.
<string><NOFAC>Thank you for procuring those<lf>materials. Now we may begin<lf>setting up camp.

<string><NOFAC>You've found a sub-camp location in<lf>the Flooded Forest, yes? Elder Fugen has<lf>asked me to help set the camp up.
<string>I had hoped to begin right away, but<lf>there is a...disturbance in that area.<lf>May I ask you to take care of it for us?
<string>Having that sub-camp should also<lf>assist in furthering your expeditions.
<string>Think of it as a..."mutual<lf>back-scratching," if you will.
<string>Astounding work, as always.
<string><NOFAC>Thank you for removing that threat.<lf>Now we may begin setting up camp.
<string>Once finished, it will be available<lf>for you to use as a new base<lf>of operations, if you so wish.

<string><NOFAC>You've found a sub-camp location in<lf>the Sandy Plains, yes? Elder Fugen has<lf>asked me to help set the camp up.
<string>But there is a slight problem getting<lf>in the way of our work. I hoped we<lf>could ask you to hunt it.
<string>Having that sub-camp should also<lf>assist in furthering your expeditions.
<string>Think of it as a...<lf>"tit for tat," as they say.
<string>Astounding work, as always.
<string><NOFAC>Thank you for ensuring our safety.<lf>Now we may begin setting up camp.
<string>Once finished, it will be available<lf>for you to use as a new base<lf>of operations, if you so wish.

<string><NOFAC>You've found a sub-camp location in<lf>the Sandy Plains, yes? Elder Fugen has<lf>asked me to help set the camp up.
<string>However, we've currently exhausted our<lf>supply of construction materials. Might<lf>I ask for you to procure some for us?
<string>Materials that are soft and have<lf>a smooth feel would be ideal.
<string>Having that sub-camp should also<lf>assist in furthering your expeditions.
<string>Astounding work, as always.
<string><NOFAC>Thank you for gathering those materials.<lf>Now we may begin setting up camp.
<string>Once finished, it will be available<lf>for you to use as a new base<lf>of operations, if you so wish.
<string>It should be ready for you before<lf>you embark on your next quest.
<string>Might you spare a moment?
<string><NOFAC>You've found a sub-camp location in<lf>the Lava Caverns, yes? Elder Fugen has<lf>asked me to help set the camp up.
<string>We can begin preparing once<lf>the danger there is quelled<lf>and the location secured.
<string>Having that sub-camp should also<lf>assist in furthering your expeditions.
<string>Think of it as a...<lf>"win-win situation," as they say.
<string>Astounding work, as always.
<string><NOFAC>Thank you again for your help.<lf>Now we may begin setting up camp.
<string>Once finished, it will be available<lf>for you to use as a new base<lf>of operations, if you so wish.
<string>It should be ready for you before<lf>you embark on your next quest.
<string>Might you spare a moment?
<string><NOFAC>You've found a sub-camp location in<lf>the Lava Caverns, yes? Elder Fugen has<lf>asked me to help set the camp up.
<string>Unfortunately, we have just run<lf>out of the necessary materials...<lf>May we rely on you to procure them?
<string>They should be sturdy materials that can<lf>endure the harshest of environments.
<string>Having that sub-camp should also<lf>assist in furthering your expeditions.
<string>Astounding work, as always.
<string><NOFAC>Thank you for providing us such quality<lf>items. Now we may begin setting up camp.
<string>Once finished, it will be available<lf>for you to use as a new base<lf>of operations, if you so wish.
<string>It should be ready for you before<lf>you embark on your next quest.
<string>Might you spare a moment?
<string><NOFAC>Master <PL>, your<lf>continuous endeavors are indisputable<lf>proof of your ability.
<string>So, I would like to propose<lf>a little challenge of sorts.
<string>It won't be an easy one, but it's sure<lf>to be well within your capabilities.
<string>Well? Might you prove to me<lf>your skill once more?
<string>Astounding work, as always.
<string><NOFAC>To capture <COLS RED>Magnamalo</COL>—such a feat is<lf>truly incredible. With you here, Kamura<lf>shall have nothing to worry about...
<string>And neither will I, knowing that I will<lf>never need to take up arms agai—<lf>*ahem* E-Excuse me, I misspoke.
<string>In any case, there is a weapon that I'd<lf>like a skilled hunter like you to have.<lf>The blueprints are now at the Smithy.
<string>I hope that you find it useful in your<lf>future endeavors.
<string>Oh my, it's—!
<string><NOFAC>Master <PL>,<lf>that artifact you have there...<lf>May I take a glimpse at it?
<string>Hmm, I see... Fascinating.<lf>Immensely fascinating indeed...
<string>...This is an <COLS RED>Old Message</COL>, a trace<lf>legacy of bygone eras most obscure.
<string>Ostensibly, this record contains<lf>someone's story, yet undiscovered.<lf>That makes it an invaluable item.
<string>For the longest time—perhaps influenced<lf>by my trade—I have sought such annals<lf>to broaden my understanding of the world.
<string>If you would be so kind as to show me any<lf>others you come across, I'd gladly offer<lf>a token of thanks, small as it may be.
<string>I'd venture that these Old Messages are frag-<lf>mented into smaller notes, which lie in places<lf>remote and unaccustomed to human activity.
<string>I wish you luck in your hunt for<lf>them, and thank you in advance.
<string>Oh my, it's—!
<string><NOFAC>If I'm correct, you've pieced enough notes<lf>together to form a complete Message, yes?<lf>Well then, if you don't mind...
<string>Mhmm... Hmm...
<string>Well! I see now... Hmmmmmm...
<string>Egads! To think, such a thing came to pass—!
<string>...Yes, that was an enlightening read indeed.
<string>As thanks, I shall present you with<lf>an especially exclusive article. One<lf>not usually available in my store.
<string>This time, I offer a set of truly bespoke<lf>ornaments depicting the legendary Wind<lf>and Thunder Serpents themselves.
<string>It was my thinking that there<lf>could be no gift more fitting<lf>for their vanquisher.
<string>Master <PL>, it appears<lf>that you have pieced together all<lf>the Old Messages in their entirety.
<string>I can't thank you enough for doing so, and<lf>so tirelessly. They have led me, decisively,<lf>to a new height of understanding.
<string>No matter where or when it may be, all living<lf>creatures share common behaviors, rituals,<lf>and feelings with their kind and one another.
<string>...As I uncovered this meaning while reading,<lf>a modest verse also came to me, as did a<lf>title for it: "The Saving Flame of Kamura."
<string>I, too, for centuries to come, hope to pass<lf>on the tale of our village and its citizens,<lf>who bravely stood against the Rampage.
<string>Oh my, it's—!

<string>Please do come by any time.
<string><NOFAC>Master <PL>, via one particular...<lf>distribution channel of mine, an item of<lf>unusual interest has come into my possession.
<string>When left with materials inside it for<lf>but a short while, this curious utensil<lf>will transform them into talismans.
<string>It is called a <COLS RED>melding pot</COL>. I have already<lf>finished setting it up, so you may begin<lf>using it right away, if you so wish.
<string>Oh, and by the by, I happen to have<lf>a selection of new goods in store. Do<lf>feel free to peruse them at your leisure.

<string><NOFAC>A moment, Master <PL>? I have<lf>new information that may interest you.
<string>Firstly: after a little independent study of<lf>the melding pot, I believe I have stumbled<lf>upon a new melding protocol of sorts.
<string>It requires greater quantities of materials,<lf>but produces much more powerful talismans.<lf>I encourage you to try it out for yourself.
<string>Secondly: I was able to engineer<lf>the pot to meld more talismans<lf>at one time.
<string>I hope that these additions<lf>are a boon to your hunts.

<string>Please do come by any time.
<string><NOFAC>A moment, Master <PL>? I have<lf>new information that may interest you.
<string>Firstly: after a little independent study of<lf>the melding pot, I believe I have stumbled<lf>upon a new melding protocol of sorts.
<string>It requires greater quantities of materials,<lf>but produces much more powerful talismans.<lf>I encourage you to try it out for yourself.
<string>Secondly: I was able to engineer<lf>the pot to meld more talismans<lf>at one time.
<string>I hope that these additions<lf>are a boon to your hunts.
