<string>Oh, <PL>. Hello. How are you?<lf>So...this is Elgado.
<string>......
<string>Sorry. I'm just finding it hard to get<lf>used to things here. To be honest,<lf>all I want is to go back home.
<string>But I'd hate to drag Hinoa back to Kamura<lf>when she's having such a good time. So<lf>I'm trying my hardest to enjoy myself, too.
<string>Oh, hello, <PL>,<lf>How are you finding life here in Elgado?
<string>I'm starting to get used to it myself and<lf>I'm slowly making friends, too!
<string>The other day, Lady Fiorayne even gave<lf>me a short tour.
<string>But guess what she asked me? She asked<lf>if I'd go speak with Princess Chichae<lf>because she's interested in Kamura!
<string>What in the world would I say to her!?<lf>I mean, I'm sure she's lovely, but...<lf>she's...she's a princess!
<string>Oh, dear...<lf>Maybe leaving Kamura was a mistake.
<string>Chichae is so lovely! So hard working,<lf>and just plain adorable!
<string>I was thinking she reminded me of<lf>someone, and then it hit me! She's<lf>just like Yomogi!
<string>She's really focused on her work,<lf>and bold in the things she does.<lf>And somehow beautiful to watch.
<string>Oops! I-I don't imagine you're supposed<lf>to speak that way about a princess!<lf>I'll be more careful in future.
<string><PL>...<lf>So you're alright? I heard you were<lf>attacked by Malzeno!
<string>You were attacked by an elder dragon<lf>and you don't even have a scratch on you?<lf>Are you made of steel or something!?
<string>I was worried when I heard that Lady<lf>Fiorayne had been wounded... But she<lf>seems to be completely fine.
<string>I'm sure you both could do with a rest,<lf>but I don't suppose that's possible...
<string><VO:SER>I heard about what happened<lf>to Lady Fiorayne...
<string>She is to the people of Elgado what Hinoa<lf>is to Kamura. She's their brightly shining<lf>sun, warming the hearts of everyone.
<string>If something like that happened to Hinoa,<lf>I'd be beside myself. Like I was during<lf>the whole Ibushi thing.
<string>So when I think how Lady Rondine<lf>must be feeling... It breaks my heart.
<string>The other day my sister, Chichae, and<lf>me all had tea together and talked about<lf>our jobs.
<string>Chichae is a princess of course, but she<lf>worked as hard as she could to get<lf>qualified so she could help her Kingdom.
<string>What spirit she has! It's spurred me<lf>on to work harder and achieve more<lf>myself.
<string>...I never even dreamed that I might<lf>meet someone like that one day.
<string>It's funny... At first, I never even dreamed<lf>of leaving Kamura, but now that I've made<lf>new friends, I'm so happy I did.
<string>What strange weather. It's making me<lf>feel a little uneasy... I haven't had a<lf>feeling like this since coming here...
<string>......<lf>They say premonitions happen for<lf>a reason.
<string>I hope it's just my imagination getting<lf>the better of me, but still...<lf>Be careful, <PL>.
<string>The threat's gone...<lf>I feel like you can see it on the faces<lf>of everyone here in Elgado, don't you?
<string>And it's all thanks to your amazing skills,<lf><PL>. You've saved us again!
<string>I hope that even though it's over now,<lf>Kamura and Elgado— No, the entire<lf>Kingdom, will continue to collaborate.
<string>...Well, I suppose we should be getting<lf>back home soon then, <PL>.
<string>I do like Elgado. But even so...<lf>there's nowhere I feel more comfortable<lf>than in Kamura.
<string><PL>! *gasp*<lf>...Sorry. I didn't mean to blurt out your<lf>name like that. It's just...
<string>I don't know anyone here and if Hinoa<lf>wasn't here with me, I would have been<lf>on the first boat back to Kamura.
<string>Of course, Hinoa seems completely at<lf>ease talking to people here. But I just<lf>don't—
<string>Ugh... I need to stop comparing myself<lf>to Hinoa. I'm just not a people person<lf>like she is.
<string>It's totally fine that I do things the way<lf>I'm comfortable with. There's nothing<lf>wrong with that, right?
<string>Did you hear about my pictures?<lf>They...they seem to be popular here.<lf>I have no idea why, but there are!
<string>The other day someone even asked me<lf>to sign one of them! At first, I thought it<lf>was for some kind paperwork...
<string>Lady Rondine did tell me once that a lot<lf>of people in the Kingdom liked my art.
<string>But I thought she was just being polite.<lf>I never imagined it was actually true!
<string>I mean, my clumsy old pictures? Why!?<lf>It's, it's kind of scary...
<string>Since we—actually, since Hinoa came to<lf>Elgado, Bunny Dango sales have gone<lf>through the roof!
<string>Demand for dango was already quite high<lf>here in Elgado, I hear, but I don't imagine<lf>anyone eats as many as Hinoa!
<string>She's been rediscovering Azuki's cooking<lf>and loving every bite! I think her appetite<lf>has doubled...maybe even tripled!
<string>I've already asked Chef Otemai and<lf>Hobashira to increase the supply of<lf>dango ingredients coming in.
<string>And of course I spoke to Azuki as well.<lf>She's been very understanding. She said<lf>it gave her a sense of satisfaction.
<string>I was speaking to that scientist—Bahari,<lf>is it? He said he wanted to ask me<lf>questions about the Rampage.
<string>But he spoke so fast and had so many<lf>questions, I didn't know what to do.
<string>So I panicked and told him to go<lf>ask my sister!
<string>I feel so bad for doing that to her, but<lf>it's already stressful enough being here...
<string>Maybe I should tell her and apologize,<lf>but then again...
<string>...Hinoa would be so much better at<lf>dealing with him!
<string>Doctor Tadori is a really wonderful<lf>doctor, isn't he?
<string>And an old friend of Kagero, I hear...<lf>Oddly enough, they do seem a little<lf>alike in some ways.
<string>When I first arrived here, I thought I<lf>didn't know anyone. But there are quite<lf>a few connections, as it turns out.
<string>Like with Lady Fiorayne and Minayle.<lf>And of course there are people like<lf>Azuki and Nagi from Kamura as well.
<string>I shouldn't have been so quick to dismiss<lf>Elgado as a place where I had no friends.<lf>I regret that now.
<string>I got the strangest request earlier...
<string>They asked me to do some live painting!<lf>D-Does that mean what I think it means?
<string>B-But I can't paint! And I definitely can't<lf>paint in front of people! I'd lay an egg!
<string>Not me! No way! I just can't! I'll have<lf>to find a polite way to refuse...
