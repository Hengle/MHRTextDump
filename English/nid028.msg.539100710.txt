<string><PL>!<lf>What are you doing here?
<string>You're out shopping with Hinoa?<lf>I know your momma taught you better!<lf>You better not keep her waiting!
<string>Welcome, <PL>!<lf>That fine weapon of yours<lf>sure looks heavy.
<string>You're finally a Hunter of Kamura...<lf>That's really something. It's a good<lf>look for you!
<string>Listen, you know what they say:<lf>You are what you eat. So a good<lf>hunter should eat good food.
<string>Well, all the food here in Kamura is<lf>fresh and nutritious—no complaints<lf>there—so...just eat your fill of it!
<string>Seihaku's salesboy skills are<lf>really coming along, but...
<string>Whenever I take my eyes off him, his<lf>gaze goes straight to Komitsu. I just<lf>don't know what to do with that boy.
<string>What do I think about the Rampage?<lf>Well, it sure sounds dangerous...
<string>I guess preparing in advance<lf>is probably the way to go in<lf>this kind of situation.
<string>You make sure you're well-prepared too.<lf>How? Well, if you ask me, you should<lf>eat well and get a good night's sleep!
<string>I heard about the ghosts in the Shrine<lf>Ruins. The children are scared stiff—<lf>we can't get them to sleep at night.
<string>Even my boy Seihaku is nervous.<lf>He acts tough, but you can tell<lf>it's giving him the willies.
<string>What's that? What do you mean<lf>I'm looking a little pale?
<string>Ha-Hahaha! Don't be absurd! I've seen<lf>a few things in my time. At my age,<lf>how could I be sc-scared of ghosts? HA!

<string>Well, this is it!<lf>How are your preparations going?
<string>I have to look after the children, so<lf>I can't go to the Stronghold. But we'll<lf>all be cheering for you from here!
<string>Thank the heavens that everyone's<lf>safe! If things keep going like this,<lf>we should pull through, right?
<string>Oh yeah, I heard you figured out what<lf>was behind those ghosts. Apparently,<lf>it was something called...Magnamalo?
<string>See, the creepy thing about ghosts is<lf>that normal weapons probably just<lf>pass right through them...
<string>But monsters: you hit them, they're<lf>defeated, and then they stay down.<lf>So go get 'em for us, <PL>!
<string>You know the tea dealers who make<lf>Bunny Dango? They actually<lf>buy their ingredients from us.
<string>Oh, you didn't know that? Yes!<lf>That fine dining experience is<lf>powered by these very veggies.
<string>But don't overdo it on the dango.<lf>It's very important to balance your diet<lf>with plenty of fresh fruit and veggies.
<string>*huff* *huff*<lf>Oh, hello, <PL>!
<string>Seihaku and I have spent half the day<lf>making giant rice balls for the village<lf>defenders. We've only just finished.
<string>To be honest, I'm a little tired after<lf>all that. But it's nothing compared to<lf>the efforts of the defenders, of course!
<string>Watch yourself out there. We're<lf>all expecting our brave fighters<lf>to come back in one piece! OK?
<string><PL>! Is it true? Did<lf>Elder Fugen really give you his prized<lf>sword for defeating Magnamalo?
<string>When I was little, my great-grandfather<lf>used to say, "That old sword is hiding<lf>away terrific, unbelievable power!"
<string>I dunno, maybe it just made for a good<lf>bedtime story. Do tell me if it starts<lf>glowing or humming or something.
<string>Y'know, there are some days when<lf>Seihaku doesn't eat a darn thing.<lf>Says he has no appetite.
<string>And they're always the same<lf>days that he talks to Komitsu.<lf>No mystery there, huh?
<string>He denies it, of course, but he<lf>can't fool his own mother!<lf>I can see right through him.
<string><PL>, are you heading<lf>to the Gathering Hub?
<string>I should show my face round there more<lf>often. Maybe I'll head over for a drink<lf>or two later. Oh, are you surprised?
<string>Sitting by the river, late at night,<lf>gazing at the moon's reflection and<lf>slowly sipping away... I just love it.

<string>Sitting by the river, late at night,<lf>gazing at the moon's reflection and<lf>slowly sipping away... I just love it.
<string>I heard there's a massive Rampage<lf>horde heading towards us!
<string>We're working with the rice merchants<lf>to ensure a seamless supply line.<lf>Leave feeding the troops to us!
<string>So resonating with that monster really<lf>did a number on poor Hinoa. No wonder<lf>the poor dear looked so ill.
<string>Komitsu was so worried, she cried for<lf>hours. And when Seihaku saw Komitsu<lf>in that state, he lost his head too.
<string>It was getting so bad, I was ready<lf>to give him a clip or two 'round<lf>the ear to snap him out of it.
<string>He IS still a kid; I guess he can't<lf>cope with that kind of stress yet.<lf>But I do wish he'd grow up a bit.
<string>My boy Seihaku's been looking kind<lf>of blue these last couple of days.
<string>It's because of Komitsu—I'm sure of it.<lf>I always say, if love is all you have to<lf>worry about then life is good! Hahaha!
<string>Tsuriki was here today. He bought<lf>rice balls from Seihaku, so I gave<lf>him some veggies on the house.
<string>He only eats meat and fish and hardly<lf>touches vegetables. I try to get some<lf>vitamins into him whenever I can.
<string><PL>, next time you<lf>see him, make sure you also tell<lf>him to eat more greens!
<string>You're heading out to take down<lf>Ibushi, right? Do be careful, OK?
<string>Between the Rampage and poor Hinoa<lf>falling ill...the village couldn't bear it if<lf>something happened to you too.
<string><PL>!<lf>You did a fantastic job! Honestly!
<string>You put that Ibushi on the run, and Hinoa<lf>is looking so much better!
<string>What wonderful news! I know the Rampage<lf>isn't gone for good, but we can handle that<lf>together when the time comes.
<string>So Ibushi's "queen" is this<lf>Thunder Serpent Narwa...
<string>And this time it's taken hold of Minoto.<lf>She may look like she's OK, but I don't fully<lf>believe that. We need to stop that creature!
<string>You're going, aren't you? Well, you were<lf>nominated by the Guild, so I suppose you<lf>can't refuse.
<string>Don't worry about the village;<lf>we'll take care of things here.<lf>You just take care out there.
<string>Seihaku, Komitsu, and I are all waiting<lf>for you to come back safe and sound!
<string>Honestly, for you to be able to stand<lf>up against Narwa like that...you've<lf>truly grown into a fine hunter.
<string>We can't relax just yet, but as<lf>long as we have you, <PL><lf>I know we have nothing to fear.
<string>When you're rich and famous, be sure<lf>to tell people all about Kamura Village.<lf>It's sure to bring in lots of customers!
<string>The Rampage may be persistent,<lf>but it's got nothing on the<lf>good cheer of Kamura.
<string>A huge part of that is thanks<lf>to you; we villagers draw from<lf>your strength and bravery.
<string>So keep it up, Hunter of Kamura!
<string>Hi there, <PL>. Are your weapons<lf>and armor all good to go? How about your<lf>items? Didn't forget anything, did you?
<string>Hah, what am I saying? You're a first-rate,<lf>top-notch hunter now. No need for me to<lf>fuss over you like a mother hen anymore!
<string>I'm simply gonna wait here knowing you'll<lf>make your way home safe!
<string><PL>! Welcome! How are things?
<string>The Rampage is almost completely gone, so<lf>I bet Kamura will return to its lively,<lf>hustle-and-bustle self pretty soon.
<string>And we've got you to thank for it.<lf>Thank you, <PL>!
<string>Seihaku's sales boy skills are<lf>really coming along, but...
<string>Whenever I take my eyes off him, his<lf>gaze goes straight to Komitsu. I just<lf>don't know what to do with that boy.

<string>My boy Seihaku won't stop saying mean<lf>things to Komitsu. As his mother,<lf>I'm downright ashamed, I truly am.
<string>I'm always scolding him for it, but<lf>it's like he just can't help himself.
<string>I know that boys will be boys—they<lf>always pick on the girls they like—<lf>but this is going a bit far.

<string>You know, something very interesting<lf>just happened.
<string>The other day, Komitsu went up to<lf>Seihaku and asked him directly if he<lf>likes her or hates her. Just like that!
<string>He stormed off, his face as red as<lf>a Rathalos, screaming and shouting.<lf>The boy's been in a haze ever since.
<string>That's a pretty original way to deal<lf>with a bully, don't you think? Good<lf>on you, Komitsu, you little cutie!
<string>It's a good lesson for Seihaku.<lf>Or at least, it will be if he's<lf>mature enough to learn from it...

<string>Do you have a minute?
<string>The other day, I saw this crazy-looking<lf>type of corn Rondine was selling.
<string>It was huge. I mean, HUGE! It was the most<lf>ridiculous cob of corn I had ever seen! So,<lf>I bought it and it was amazing!
<string>I wanted to thank Rondine by giving<lf>her some bamboo shoots to try, but...<lf>I'm all out of them.
<string>I hate to ask, but do you think you<lf>could go gather some more for me?
<string>Oh, you are a lifesaver!
<string>Thank you SO much!
<string>By the way, on the way to see Rondine,<lf>I overheard something..."interesting."
<string>Apparently, Master Hamon and Nakago<lf>saw that gigantic corn too, and then made<lf>a new weapon that looks just like it!
<string>Those guys draw inspiration from just about<lf>anywhere—Hey! Why haven't they made<lf>any weapons that look like MY produce!?
