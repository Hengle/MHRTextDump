<string>I hope this helps me become<lf>more like Hinoa...
<string>What good training this was!<lf>I promise to keep improving!
<string>If it's to keep Hinoa safe,<lf>I'll take down any monster!
<string>Full disclosure: I strongly<lf>dislike the outdoors.
<string>I hope Master Hojo<lf>is doing OK...
<string>More experience will only<lf>make me stronger!
<string>What did you think of my<lf>hunting today, Hinoa?
<string>I've already made the arrangements.<lf>The message should be delivered by now.
<string>Let's make our way back.
<string>Ah, well... Uh, thank you...<lf>Shall we head back, now? Please?
<string>...I think I'll pass. I've been<lf>outside long enough.
<string>All right, let's hurry up<lf>and get back.
<string>...I think I'll just walk.<lf>Slow and steady wins the race, right?
<string>If I can ensure Hinoa's safety through<lf>my actions, that's all that matters.
<string>The rumors in the village were true,<lf>you're no ordinary person.
