<string>I heard the Kingdom was interested in<lf>Master Hamon's skills and asked him<lf>to move shop. He refused, of course.
<string>So instead, this gorgeous lady came<lf>from the Kingdom to train under him,<lf>and then the craziest thing happened!
<string>Almost as soon as she got here, she was<lf>right back on the boat home! She mastered<lf>Master Hamon's techniques in no time!
<string>Can you believe it? At first I was kinda<lf>upset with my training being put on hold<lf>and all but that lady's something else!
<string>Still kinda jealous, but, oh well...<lf>Gotta do what we can for the people.<lf>Either way, I'd better step up my game.
<string>...My beloved Hinoa. As stunning as ever<lf>today! I bet she'll look just as stunning<lf>tomorrow, and the day after, and the day—
<string>I mean, just look at her track record<lf>up to now. She was a beauty yesterday,<lf>and every single day before that!
<string>Not only that but I bet she'll be just<lf>as kind tomorrow, and the next day,<lf>and the next-next day!
<string>I mean, have you seen how kind she was<lf>yesterday, and the day before that, and—<lf>*sigh* I can't stop thinking about her!
<string>Oh, hey, <PL>.<lf>How's the Kingdom treating ya?<lf>Getting homesick for ol' Kamura yet?
<string>I spent a little time out in the world<lf>myself, y'know! Just a little, way<lf>back when.
<string>Everything was so fresh and new, and<lf>I had a blast out there, but eventually<lf>I found myself itching to head home.
<string>I bet you know the feeling, don't you?<lf>Well don't be afraid to show your face<lf>around here when the mood strikes ya!
<string>Listen to this, <PL>!<lf>Hinoa, she...she...
<string>She said, "good morning"! A transcendent<lf>greeting—the very earth trembled, her<lf>voice a veritable chorus of angels!
<string>And Ikari responded in kind, of course!<lf>—Me? Oh, I just watched from here. The<lf>exchange had nothing to do with me.
<string>Oh, if only she'd greet me, too! Maybe<lf>if I just casually cross her path... Oh,<lf>but heaven forbid I obstruct her view!
<string>Oh, my head...<lf>It feels like it's gonna split in two!
<string>Argh! Please, <PL>...<lf>Use your inside voice. Yes, just like<lf>that... That's better.
<string>Hinoa went to see Minoto last night.<lf>Chit-chatting with Otemai, Maido,<lf>and the rest, you see.
<string>I just gazed at them, drinking all the<lf>while. Hanamori kept me company,<lf>and we just kept slinging them back.
<string>And thus, the broken shell of a man<lf>before you. Ah, but this is pain from my<lf>sweet Hinoa! I should savor every drop!
<string>Oh hey, <PL>!<lf>Welcome back!
<string>I'm so jealous... My beloved Hinoa seems<lf>a little down when you're away from Kamura.<lf>I wish she'd think about me that way!
<string>Can't say I blame her, though. I feel<lf>the same since you've been gone.<lf>Especially since we grew up together!
<string>—Wait. D-Does this mean my beloved<lf>Hinoa and I are totally vibing right now!?
<string>Th-This is a new milestone! And it's<lf>all thanks to you, and the fact that<lf>you left Kamura.
<string>Thank you, <PL>. Really.<lf>Remember no matter where you are, my<lf>beloved Hinoa and I are rooting for ya!
<string>Anyway, the whole village feels the same.<lf>We're all counting on you!
