<string>Well, if it isn't good ol' <PL>!<lf>All ready to go?
<string>If you can, why not take some rice<lf>with you? Should be plenty of space<lf>on that big ol' ship.
<string>If you ever run out while you're out there,<lf>just let me know and I'll send you more.<lf>Or you can come back and pick it up.
<string>Welcome back, <PL>.<lf>Gettin' enough rice in ya?
<string>I know there's all kinds of food out<lf>there, but rice is what made you who<lf>you are today.
<string>Remember, rice is an awesome source<lf>of energy. So make sure to eat some of<lf>those dango before a hunt, OK?
<string>There's a few shops outside the village<lf>that sell Bunny Dango, and most of 'em<lf>use our rice.
<string>It's a lot of work, I know... But in this<lf>business, it's better to be busy, so<lf>I'm grateful there's a demand.
<string>Of course, we're shipping a lot of rice to<lf>Elgado, too. Well, not as much as we<lf>use here in the village. Not even close...
<string>I mean rice is a staple of every<lf>traditional dish in Kamura. Rice<lf>balls, Bunny Dango...
<string>But half of it goes to those gluttons,<lf>Elder Fugen and Hinoa! I swear they'd<lf>eat all of it if we let 'em!
<string>You're a top-notch hunter now, so<lf>you need to make sure you keep<lf>yourself in top-notch condition.
<string>And the key to keeping yourself in<lf>top-notch condition is rice!
<string>I mean, look at my wife. She's<lf>pretty as a picture thanks to all<lf>the rice she eats.
<string>I'm not just sayin' this for my health!<lf>It's true. Rice is life! It helps you perform<lf>your best and look good doin' it, too!
<string>Maybe it's because I'm just a simple<lf>rice farmer, but I just can't understand<lf>the appeal of Shiika's poetry...
<string>Maybe I just don't understand art?<lf>I don't know. I did like the poem<lf>you wrote about my wife though!
<string>It was so good in fact, that I asked<lf>Master Hojo to frame it with a picture<lf>of my wife.
<string>It's really nice to look at when I come<lf>home from a hard day of work.
<string>Today is a great day.<lf>Perfect rice, and a perfect wife.
<string>You know, <PL>.<lf>This is the life, I tell ya.
