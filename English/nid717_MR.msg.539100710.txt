<string>Urk... Oh, my poor stomach...<lf>Ah, g-good day, Hunter.
<string>You must...*burp* must be the one Dame<lf>Fiorayne spoke of. Th-that's...*hic*<lf>quite the constitution you've got there.
<string>If I b-became a hunter, could I *hic*<lf>get over my seasickness? Ah, b-but that<lf>won't do. I'm a m-man of the sea...*burp*
<string>Hrrrk! *burp* Th-that was a close one...
<string>Greetings, Hunter. I apologize for our<lf>previous encounter. I was so seasick I<lf>could hardly hold a conversation.
<string>Hmm? Oh, yes, I've had to board a ship<lf>today. That's why I'm in such good shape<lf>today.
<string>What's that? I don't look in great shape?<lf>W-Well now that you mention it... I'm<lf>not f-feeling too hot all of a sudden...
<string>Oh, it's you, Hunter. Do you have some<lf>business on the ship?
<string>I see, so you're setting sail for Kamura<lf>Village, and— *u-urp* Oh dear, just<lf>th-thinking about it makes me... Hrrk...
<string>Ah, *hic* w-welcome back, Hunter...<lf>Oh dear, I was f-fine until just a moment ago...
<string>It's just, watching your *urp* ship<lf>arrive in the harbor made my stomach—<lf>*burp* Oh, I can't even say it...
<string>Oh, h-hey, Hunter. Um, so my buddy...<lf>*hic* gave me a word of...*hurp* advice<lf>the other d-day.
<string>He said if I wuh...watch ships bobbing<lf>in the water, and bobbed along with them,<lf>I wuh...wouldn't get seasick so easily.
<string>N-Not to be presumptuous, but...*hurp*<lf>I think it's having the opposite effect...<lf>Urk... Oh dear...
<string>A th-thought crosses my mind whenever<lf>a *hurk* queasy spell h-hits me...
<string>Why... *ulp* why would the Guild allow<lf>s-someone like me to join the research<lf>team?
<string>For me... *burp* th-that mystery is—<lf>*hurk* much more p-perplexing than<lf>the crater could ever b-be...
<string>H-Hey, Hunter. Is, is it just me, or...<lf>*hurp* is the pier a bit wuh...wobbly<lf>today...?
<string>S-So it is just me, then? *hic* I f-figured<lf>as much...
<string>I've h-had enough of this *hurk* sea...<lf>sickness. It's about t-time I... *ulp*<lf>oh...overcome this debilitation.
<string>Superstitions, old wives' t-tales—<lf>you name it, I'll t-try it! *ulp*<lf>Anything at this point...
<string>Oh, thank g-goodness. Elgado owes<lf>you a debt of gratitude, H-Hunter. *hic*<lf>Bahari is an important individual here.
<string>After all, h-he promised to... *ugh*<lf>find a cure f-for my seasickness<lf>one day... *ulp*
<string>...<lf>......<lf>.........
<string>Hurrrk...<lf>............Whew.
<string>M-My apologies, that bout has subsided...<lf>I fear I can't even risk opening my mouth<lf>on such precarious occasions.
<string>*Hic* Oh d-dear... *hurk* I h-haven't<lf>even...ridden a boat today...*hack*
<string>Last night I... *ulp* h-had a dream<lf>about s-setting out to sea. I've b-been<lf>like this since I woke up... *burp*
<string>I, um, I heard a story f-from a kindly<lf>t-traveling merchant the other day...<lf>*hic*
<string>He s-said that monster broth is an...<lf>*ulp* effective remedy for... W-Well,<lf>you know.
<string>I kind of want to t-try it... *hurk*<lf>Still, you don't think he's some... *urp*<lf>snake wyvern oil salesman, d-do you?
<string>This is just conjecture, but d-do you<lf>think... *hngh* the Qurio could be the<lf>source of my c-condition?
<string>Hurrrk! N-No, I didn't think so, either...
<string>If I was bitten by a Q-Qurio—like all<lf>those monsters... *hic*
<string>D-Do you think the shock could... *hack*<lf>c-cure me of this seasickness?
<string>Oh, but j-just the idea of getting...<lf>*ulp* gnawed by one of those f-fiends<lf>makes me— Hrrrk! *burp*
<string>To think the... *urp* Malzeno possessed<lf>such poison... Toxic enough to p-put<lf>someone in a coma.
<string>Compared to... *hulp* to that, someone<lf>like me sh-should count their b-blessings,<lf>right? Ha...haha— *hurk* Ugh.
<string>The s-same symptoms as the... *hic*<lf>the pl-plague of o-old? Y-you think a medicine<lf>for that w-would...*burp* work for me, too?
<string>Ah, but I... *hulp* guess it'd b-be easier<lf>to just get meds for my own affliction, huh?
<string>F-Fiorayne has made a m-miraculous<lf>recovery, from the... *hurk* looks of it.<lf>H-Her recovery invigorated me! *ulp*
<string>So riding that high, I... *hic* tried<lf>boarding a ship. That's when I had<lf>an uh, *hngh* epiphany.
<string>Vigor, courage...n-none of that has<lf>anything to do with... *hulp*<lf>s-seasickness.
<string>F-Finally...! Now Bahari and the doctor<lf>have some room to b-breathe, yes? That<lf>means they can finally focus on my—
<string>Wh-What do you mean, the... *hurp*<lf>investigations aren't over yet? Throw<lf>me a... *burp* b-bone, here...
<string>I thought I'd gotten used to all k-kinds<lf>of oscillations lately...
<string>But then I was raised up by a wuh, work<lf>crane, and it swayed...and swayed...<lf>*hic* and s-swayed...
<string>All of my training was for... *hurk*<lf>n-naught. But I'm sure I don't have to<lf>tell you that, n-now, do I? *huuurk*
<string>Th-This is no time for me to let some...<lf>*urk* n-nautical nausea get the better<lf>of me...
<string>Just now, I finished ch-charting the...<lf>*hulp* optimal sea route for you.
<string>That means accurate p-passage to and<lf>f-from Elgado. *ulp* N-No issues coming<lf>or going!
<string>Good day to you, Hunter! Heading off on<lf>a quest, are you?
<string>My seasickness? Why, of course I'm fine,<lf>as you can well see! No matter how rough<lf>the waves get, you can count on me!
<string>All of that is thanks to Doctor Tadori<lf>finding an effective concoction for me.
<string>Now then, let me know when you're ready<lf>to ship out, Hunter! I'll show you what<lf>a navigator like me is capable of.
<string>I have a bit of...*ulp* confidence in<lf>s-setting efficient sea routes, even...<lf>*hurk* even in this s-sorry state.
<string>S-Surely this stems from a... *hulp*<lf>d-desire to limit my time on the water<lf>to the absolute m-minimum...
<string>From what I can tell, H-Hunter, Kamura<lf>is in... *gulp* possession of some rather<lf>inscrutable t-techniques...
<string>That wouldn't h-happen to include some<lf>legendary... *urk* secret... *hurk* f-fast-<lf>acting seasickness remedy, would it?
<string>Incidentally, Hunter, are th-there any...<lf>*hulp* B-Bunny Dango that afford a<lf>m-modicum of relief for motion sickness?
<string>If s-so, they'd... *urk* be the main<lf>c-course of my three square meals<lf>every... *hic* d-day...
<string>Ah, but given the nature... *hurk* of this<lf>b-beast, they might come back up as<lf>quickly as they g-go down. *burp*
<string>I would love to... *hic* consult Bahari<lf>about how to... *ulp* d-deal with this<lf>maritime m-misery.
<string>And yet, I can tell how b-busy he is with<lf>his... *hulp* monster research. So f-for<lf>now, all I can do is ch-cheer on his work.
<string>After all, if he makes any h-headway...<lf>*burp* that'll free him up to work on my<lf>particular pr-problem... *hic*
<string>Hurrrk... S-Say, Hunter, I have an<lf>important que— *hic* question for you.
<string>If you saw a q-quest entitled "Teach Me<lf>How Not to Be Seasick," you'd accept it,<lf>r-right? *hurp* W-Wouldn't you?
<string>For a long, long time, I'd forgotten<lf>how exhilarating it is to be buffeted<lf>by storms and seas.
<string>According to Tadori, once I get used to<lf>such sensations I won't even need his<lf>medicine.
<string>Oh, how I long for that day to come!<lf>That's why I intend to navigate these<lf>waters as often as I can.
<string>I'll contend with the briny deep—for<lf>my future, as well as for all the pain<lf>of the past.
