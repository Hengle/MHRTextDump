<string>Greetings and Sal-mew-tations!
<string>I hope you enjoy your time here and if you<lf>need anything—I mean ANYTHING, just let<lf>me know and I'll see what I can do!
<string><NOFAC><CAM:0>Greetings and Sal-mew-tations!<lf>I'm Shirubei and I run the Buddy<lf>Plaza here! Welcome!
<string>Meow that you're a bona fide<lf>hunter, allow me to welcome<lf>you to the Buddy Plaza!
<string><CAM:1><COLS RED>Buddy Handler Iori</COL> will give you<lf>the rundown on all things Buddy.
<string>If you hire a Buddy, you'll get a trusty<lf>battle companion to aid in all your<lf>hunting endeavors!
<string><CAM:2><COLS RED>Felyne Chief Kogarashi</COL> is top-cat<lf>when it comes to managing<lf>the Meowcenaries.
<string>You can count on any Buddies you have<lf>on standby to hunt for materials while<lf>you're hunting monsters.
<string><CAM:4>This ferry goes to the <COLS RED>Training Area</COL>—What?<lf>Just because you're a hunter now doesn't<lf>mean you can start slacking on training!
<string><CAM:3>And <COLS RED>Rondine</COL> here is a trader from<lf>outside Kamura.
<string>Every good hunter needs a stock of good<lf>items! No matter how obscure, she'll<lf>probably have what you're looking fur.
<string><CAM:5>You'll find the <COLS RED>Buddy Board</COL> here,<lf>where you can manage your Buddies!
<string>There're more like it all over the village.<lf>Maybe you've already seen one?
<string>If you hire any Buddies from Iori,<lf>you can manage them here.
<string><CAM:0>Anyway, every day, the Buddies<lf>here work their tails off to get<lf>better and stronger!
<string>That's about all I've got for ya.<lf>If you wanna know more, you'll<lf>have to talk to everyone yourself!
<string>I heard Iori was with you when<lf>Magnameowlo attacked.
<string>I don't know what it is but ever since<lf>he got back, he's had this pained look<lf>on his face. I wonder how he's doing...
<string>It doesn't look like he was hurt<lf>though, so he'll be fine...right?
<string><PL>!<lf>I heard you beat Magnameowlo!
<string>Meowster Hojo showed me a drawing of it<lf>once. That's one scary-lookin' meownster!<lf>I hope it never comes near me!
<string>Anymew, taking down such a fur-ocious<lf>beast is quite a feat! Three cheers fur you,<lf><PL>!
<string>Meow-wie, <PL>!<lf>You defeated that fur-ightening<lf>meownster, Ibushi!
<string>You never cease to impurr-ess, do you?
<string>Kogarashi says the Rampage is still<lf>nippin' at our tails, but we must be<lf>getting close to stopping it meow!
<string>Meow-wie, <PL>!<lf>You sure sent that meownster packing!
<string>fur-st you put the beatdown on Ibushi,<lf>and then its girlfur-iend, Narwa!<lf>You cold, hunter.
<string>And hopefur-ly that beatdown will keep<lf>'em from showing their ugly meownster<lf>faces here again!
<string>And if they ever do, Kogarashi will<lf>find 'em and you'll give 'em another<lf>beatdown, right <PL>!?
<string>Meow-wie, <PL>!<lf>You're a real village hero meow!
<string>Oh, wait! I gotta get you to sign something.
<string>Here! Add your name, your motto...<lf>Oh, and a pawprint! I bet it'd be<lf>worth a fur-tune one day!
<string>We saw the two elder dragons<lf>here from the Buddy Plaza. It's<lf>got everyone's fur standing on end.
<string>But if you're on the case, <PL>,<lf>we shouldn't have anything to worry<lf>about.
<string>I mean, it's you, after all! Two serpents?<lf>Why stop there? I bet you could take<lf>a whole army of 'em, no pur-roblem!
<string>Welcome back, <PL>.<lf>You made beatin' those two elder dragons<lf>look easy!
<string>We were relieved when we heard<lf>that you successfully took those<lf>terrors down, but...
<string>Everyone REALLY cheered once we<lf>heard that you managed to get back<lf>safe and sound!
<string>Hey, <PL>!<lf>Greetings and sal-mew-tations!
<string>Whenever you show up, all the Buddies<lf>get super excited!
<string>And I'm glad you swung by too!<lf>Hey, don't furget to say hi every<lf>meow and then.
<string>Talk to Iori if you want<lf>to recruit new Buddies.
<string>Also if you want a certain kind<lf>of Buddy, or want to change<lf>their name.
<string>Kogarashi is top-Felyne when it<lf>comes to managing the Meowcenaries!
<string>Meowcenaries can be dispatched to<lf>gather materials while you're meow-t<lf>on a quest.
<string>All of the Buddies are eager to<lf>help meow-t, so don't hesitate to<lf>call on them when you need to!
<string>Rondine is a trader from a distant land.
<string>Kotori and Chino too.<lf>Their names are...a little hard<lf>to purr-onounce, no?
<string>If you want to barter, go talk to them.
<string>They might be a little purr-culiar, but<lf>they're real cool Felynes, I purr-omise!
<string>Buddies hoping to train do so here<lf>at the Buddy Plaza, but everyone<lf>else goes to the Training Area.
<string>If you yourself want to train, you<lf>should go the Training Area as well.
<string>The Toadversary here in the middle of<lf>the Plaza is meow-ssive! Don't you<lf>think so? Meowster Hamon made it!
<string>After he made the one for the Training<lf>Area, the Buddies got jealous so he made<lf>another just for the Buddies to train with.
<string>They all helped paint and decorate it,<lf>so our's looks waaaaaay cooler!
<string>From my paws to your pocket!
<string><NOFAC><PL>! Thanks for always<lf>taking Buddies with mew on the hunt!
<string>On behalf of all the Buddies here,<lf>I'd like to give you a token of thanks.<lf>Don't stop here, though!
