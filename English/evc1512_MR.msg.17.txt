<string>Hear me, oh flames of those devoured.
<string>Restless spirits, doomed to serve<lf>a creature of malice.
<string>Your will is connected, no matter how faint.
<string>And though you are destined to fade before long—
<string>I implore you: before making your way to purgatory...
<string>You must bear witness...
<string>To the power of your own souls,<lf>manifested as relentless evil.
<string>Ultimate Malice
<string>Scorned Magnamalo
