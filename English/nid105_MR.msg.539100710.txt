<string>Meow goes it, <PL>?<lf>Everyone's saying you're on your way to<lf>the Kingdom's meowtpost. Are ya all set?
<string>No clue what's waiting for you over<lf>there. Best purr-chase everything<lf>you need before you go!
<string>You ever look at Meowster Hojo and think<lf>there's more to him than meets the eye?<lf>He has this...divine aura about him, no?
<string>And whenever he's in the Hub, business<lf>is booming. It's the strangest thing. Like<lf>he's a good luck charm, or something...
<string>Whatever it is, I hope he keeps that Hojo<lf>mojo coming...
<string>Recently, Minoto has also been traveling<lf>back and forth to Elgado.
<string>I help out a little when she's gone,<lf>you know? Take meowsages and<lf>stuff like that.
<string>Then that got me thinking. What if<lf>I became a quest receptionist? Surely<lf>that would help her meow-t a lot, right?
<string>Nothing wrong with adding a few more<lf>skills to one's re-purr-toire! I'm seriously<lf>considering it.
<string>Quest comes in, you fill this out...<lf>but then, posting said quest requires—
<string>Ah, <PL>! Welcome!<lf>My a-paw-logies, didn't see you there.
<string>I was cramming for this test coming<lf>up. If I pass, I'll be able to lend Minoto<lf>a paw with her Hub duties.
<string>But, it's so much harder than I thought<lf>it'd be! If I don't straighten my tail out,<lf>I'll never pass!
<string>Getting my certification and learning<lf>about quests is sure to help increase<lf>purr-ofits here at the shop!
<string>Like, "Don't forget to stock up on traps<lf>and tranqs before heading meow-t on<lf>that capture quest!"
<string>Talk about two Spiribirds with one stone!<lf>I'd be a Felyne fool not to do it.
<string>Well, I took the test... Un-fur-tunately,<lf>I didn't pass. I would be sad about it,<lf>but honestly, I didn't study enough.
<string>Definitely didn't study as much as<lf>Minoto did. She'd sit at the Tea Shop<lf>all day, never taking a break.
<string>Still, when I talked to her, she was<lf>real encouraging; said it'd be easier<lf>to learn the ropes by watching her.
<string>So, I'll just shadow Minoto for now and<lf>learn at my own pace. And when I take<lf>the test again, I'll pass fur sure!
