<string>Naaaah... That's not it.
<string>Man, this thing is hard to find.
<string>Hm?
<string>Who are you?
<string>Oh!
<string>Whoa!
<string>Yes! Now we're talkin'!
<string>Wow, look at this!
<string>All of this!
<string>Isn't this great!?
<string>Something strong scooped out the soil here...<lf>And there's marks of something being dragged.
<string>Look at the size of it!
<string>Garangolm...
<string>It must've passed through here.
<string>Wait...a minute.
<string>Are you...the hunter they sent to help?
<string>The one from Kamura?
<string>I knew it! The name's Bahari.<lf>Gadget expert and researcher extraordinaire.
<string>Nice to meet you!
<string>Anyway...!
<string>Garangolm aren't known for leaving their<lf>territory, so...what's this thing doing here...?
<string>Something weird is going on.
<string>Guess I gotta start investigating, huh?
<string>I'd love to head back to the outpost with you...
<string>But I need to take care of some things<lf>here first.
<string>Could you, uh... Give my regards to the Admiral?
<string>Oh, and one more thing!
<string>If you run into Fiorayne...
<string>Tell her I'm looking forward to seeing her again.
