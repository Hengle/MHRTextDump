<string>Got a little request for ya!
<string>Ahoy, Hunter! Think you can help me out?<lf>I was talking to Minayle earlier and seems<lf>she's having a bit of a dry spell.
<string>Seems she's having trouble upgrading<lf>some kind of umbrella weapon. So I got<lf>to thinking...
<string>What's something waterproof that won't tear<lf>in heavy wind? Sails, right?
<string>So if she looks at some tough, flexible<lf>sail material, maybe she'll get some<lf>ideas for an umbrella! Can you help?
<string>Hey! Let me thank you!
<string>Ahoy, Hunter! I see you got the materials<lf>for Minayle! Good on ya!
<string>I'm just an ol' salty sailor, but if my<lf>ideas help someone out, that'll put the<lf>wind in my sails!
<string>Now she can enhance the umbrella weapon.<lf>She sounds pretty confident with the<lf>results. Maybe go check it out?
<string>Ahoy, Hunter! How goes it, aye? Ah,<lf>I guess it's too early to tell, seeing as<lf>you just got here.
<string>But I wouldn't worry about it too much.<lf>I've seen all kinds of your type before...
<string>I can separate the wheat from the chaff<lf>the second you hunters step off a boat.
<string>...How do I know? You see a lot of things<lf>when you're a sailor. Just something<lf>I picked up.
<string>What is it? If it's your luggage you're<lf>looking for, we already hauled it up to<lf>your room.
<string>And you got the VIP cabin, aye? Maybe it's<lf>nothing compared to yours back on dry land...
<string>But for sailors and hunters alike, home is<lf>wherever ya lay your head. Go on take<lf>a well-earned rest. You're gonna need it!
<string>You're about to ship out? Great, think<lf>you could take some of this cargo with<lf>you?
<string>Haha! Never you worry, we'll take care<lf>of loading it all up.
<string>Anytime you're ready to weigh anchor,<lf>just let me know. Ship's ready whenever<lf>you need it.
<string>I don't want these sailors gettin' too used<lf>to dry land. Gotta keep 'em wet!
<string>The time comes you need a ship for<lf>research, you can count on ole Phino's<lf>crew. The sea's our area of expertise!
<string>On the off chance a monster comes to<lf>kick up a fuss, that's where you come in.<lf>Don't be shy, now, we're here to help!
<string>Looks like the sea's done a number on<lf>Russeau again...
<string>He's a cut above other whippersnappers<lf>when it comes to navigation.
<string>All he needs is to find the strength<lf>inside himself! That way, I plumb reckon<lf>the sea can't do a dang thing to him.
<string>You've got some urgent business waiting<lf>for you over there, don't you? Ship's<lf>ready and waiting to sail anytime.
<string>Hop to it, now! This is what we've been<lf>waiting for! We were just getting bored<lf>of all this landlubber labor, anyhoo.
<string>Oof, my aching back! My castle for a<lf>heating pad... Whoops! Guess you got<lf>a glimpse of this sad sack's sorry state.
<string>Hahaha! Can't turn back the clock, they<lf>say. This sorta labor's been killer on<lf>the ole lumbar system lately.
<string>Time'll come for you one day too,<lf>Hunter, and when you least expect it!<lf>Don't you forget—or forget to stretch.
<string>I hear they've saddled you with a real<lf>chore, is that right? Not that your usual<lf>tasks are a walk in the park, anyhow.
<string>With our friends gone, booze don't taste<lf>right, and I ain't getting a wink of sleep,<lf>neither. Bring us some good news!
<string>Fantastic job helping ol' Bahari, Hunter!<lf>Now I can sling back a nice, cold ale<lf>with relish.
<string>In fact, I think I'll get the old skinflint<lf>to buy a round! Least he could do for<lf>putting us through all that fuss.
<string>That monster's been causing all the<lf>ruckus is set to appear! I was wondering<lf>why the young'uns were working so hard.
<string>If it's got sailor's knickers in a twist,<lf>your hunter underoos must be in real<lf>knots! Heck, maybe even an anchor twist.
<string>At any rate, I get how you feel. This<lf>life ain't worth living without the<lf>occasional titillation, yeah?
<string>I heard the news—Bahari came back!<lf>By gum, I oughta drag that so-and-so<lf>out and paint the town red!
<string>Hahaha, I'm just jerking your chain.<lf>The research ain't letting up yet,<lf>now is it?
<string>Gimme a heads-up when things have calmed<lf>down a spell. I'll drag him out for a drink<lf>kicking and screaming if need be.
<string>Welp, I ain't got no fancy learning<lf>about feral critters. I just know I don't<lf>want you bringing any into the Outpost.
<string>Wait... I wouldn't put it past Bahari to<lf>sneak some in. I ought to forewarn him,<lf>before he gets any ideas...
<string>Everyone shipping out in a hurry, huh?<lf>Must be a real hootenanny you're heading<lf>off to. Come back safe and sound, y'hear?
<string>If you lost sleep over every hunter that<lf>went on a quest, you'd be up all night!<lf>Still, a fella never gets used to this.
<string>That Order filly sure was in rough<lf>order. I'm just relieved she's still<lf>among the living.
<string>Goes without saying, but the medical<lf>doohickeys and remedies here don't<lf>stack up to what they got back home.
<string>They say, "health is wealth," but that<lf>goes double out here in Elgado.
<string>Wish I could be of more help, but<lf>search parties ain't exactly my<lf>strong suit, I'm sad to say.
<string>At least you've got a lead, right? That's<lf>some kinda consolation. Hope you<lf>find something sooner rather than later.
<string>These are some special ingredients<lf>we're talking about here. Won't be<lf>a quick fix, even for the doc.
<string>Even if the medicine didn't work out as<lf>planned, at least you know what to do<lf>about it. Could be worse, I suppose.
<string>So keep your eyes on the prize,<lf>young'un, and do what you gotta do! I'd<lf>say that's easy enough to remember.
<string>Not only is the treatment working, but<lf>you tracked down Malzeno! The breeze<lf>is at our backs once again!
<string>Ain't no way we can let a headwind like<lf>this go to waste. Weigh anchor and ship<lf>out, Hunter!
<string>You keelhauled Malzeno!? Well I'll be<lf>a Rajang's uncle! You're something<lf>else, kiddo!
<string>EEEEEYOWCH! Here I go, trying to pat<lf>you on the back, and I throw out my own.<lf>Ah, but heck, it was worth it.
<string>Besides, can't hurt more than the bumps<lf>and scrapes you got thrashing that beast!<lf>DAHAHA-OWW! Fiddlesticks, not again...
<string>I know you got your hands full one way<lf>or another, but why not head back to<lf>Kamura if you got a moment to spare?
<string>Going overboard will just waterlog you<lf>when it's time to do the important work,<lf>y'know.
<string>Everyone, in all walks of life, needs<lf>a change of pace from time to time.
<string>The sea don't look too choppy, but I don't<lf>like the look of those dark clouds...
<string>Heavens alive... I ought to stow all<lf>this luggage away before I've got soggy<lf>cargo and riled clients on my hands.
<string>I've loaded up everything you'll need.<lf>The Admiral and the Order will board the<lf>huge ship when they're ready to launch.
<string>...Say, Hunter. That beastie you're<lf>about to fire broadside on...it's some-<lf>thing out of a fairy tale, ain't it?
<string>That's a monster I can't even wrap my<lf>head around. Still...I expect you'll<lf>make short work of it.
<string>Call it an old sea dog's intuition. It's<lf>usually spot-on at times like this, so<lf>feel free to place your faith in it.
<string>Ahoy! The cargo coming from the Kingdom<lf>is changing over, bit by bit.
<string>Still plenty of research supplies, but<lf>I'm seeing more trade goods, too. Proof<lf>the waters around here have calmed down.
<string>This makes Elgado an essential trade<lf>hub. Even this is the fruits of your<lf>labors, Hunter.
<string>...Right, everything's in order here.<lf>This should be good for now.
<string>Ahoy, Hunter. Lotta cargo, huh? Don't worry,<lf>we'll get it all sorted. You're in good hands<lf>here, so you can focus on your hunts!
<string>Most of the cargo coming to Elgado gets<lf>dropped off here first.
<string>Any mistakes unloading can cause real<lf>problems. Plus, some contraband might<lf>make its way into the Kingdom.
<string>So in a sense, we're just like the Order.<lf>We may not fight monsters, but we<lf>work just as hard to protect this outpost.
<string>The sea's been awful kind to us lately.<lf>Rough waters could do a real number to<lf>the more fragile cargo.
<string>I'm in no mood to add to my workload—<lf>or my backload! Especially the lower<lf>back.
<string>Ahhh, someone your age hasn't the<lf>foggiest of what I'm talking about, huh?<lf>Time'll learn ya, oh yes it will.
<string>Just by checking the cargo that comes<lf>through here, I get a good idea of the<lf>day-to-day lives of those stationed here.
<string>As a sailor, I've seen a lot of stuff, but<lf>I've never seen a haul like the one of<lf>Bunny Dango that just showed up!
<string>Don't get me wrong, they're tasty and<lf>all, but... Aren't y'all eating a bit too<lf>much of that stuff!?
<string>Supplies come over from the Kingdom<lf>periodically, some contain some of my<lf>favorite things to pull off those boats.
<string>Any guesses what it is, Hunter?<lf>Ingredients, medicine—all important,<lf>sure, but those ain't it.
<string>I'm talking about the one thing everyone's<lf>waiting for—letters and packages from<lf>their loved ones back home.
<string>You hear about Russeau, Hunter?<lf>Finally got his sea legs!
<string>The doctor honestly couldn't stand<lf>the sight of him, but I heard he<lf>prescribed him some good stuff.
<string>It's about time we got some use out of<lf>that guy. I thought he was gonna spend<lf>the rest of his days hanging over the rail.
<string>And seeing how good that medicine worked<lf>on ol' Russ, I'll have to ask him to make some<lf>for my back...
<string>Anyone willing to lend a hand?
<string>Ah, great timing! I've got a big job<lf>that only a hunter like you can handle!<lf>Got a sec for an ol' sailor?
<string>Seems there's an Espinas runnin' around<lf>attackin' some of the younger folk. It's<lf>becomin' a real problem.
<string>Us sailors can't really do anything about<lf>'em, so I was hopin' maybe you could.
<string>Do you think you can go out there and<lf>bag that monster before someone gets<lf>seriously hurt? Thanks!
<string>Great work! My thanks!
<string>A hunter in name and deed! Hopefully,<lf>that'll calm things down a bit.
<string>I've got a reward lined up too! Go check<lf>out the Smithy. You'll find something<lf>pretty special waiting to be made!
<string>As for the captured Espinas, all that lump<lf>does is sleep! Is it really the same monster<lf>attackin' everyone? Kinda hard to believe...
