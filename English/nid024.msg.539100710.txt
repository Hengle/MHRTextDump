<string>Oh hi, <PL>.<lf>You look well!
<string>We're still setting up shop; things<lf>are taking longer than we thought.<lf>Would you mind coming back later?
<string>Oh hi, <PL>.<lf>Congratulations on becoming a hunter!
<string>Being rice merchants, we don't sell<lf>anything that'll help on a hunt, but<lf>the Tea Shop uses our produce.
<string>Still, indirect as our role may be in<lf>your hunting career, both my husband<lf>and I are cheering for you!
<string>My husband holes up in the back room<lf>whenever he's coming up with a new dish.
<string>Then, when he does think of one,<lf>we make it and have Hamon try it.
<string>Hamon's an excellent chef whose<lf>palate Senari trusts more than his own.<lf>*sigh* I love that he's so open-minded.
<string>So, our success and signature dishes are<lf>all thanks to Hamon's sense of taste<lf>and my husband's accommodating nature.
<string>The Rampage won't change everything<lf>about life in Kamura, I'm sure.
<string>Take us rice merchants: we'll just<lf>keep selling food and filling up<lf>people's bellies, like we always do.
<string>Besides, you're here, we have<lf>the Stronghold, and everyone's<lf>trained for it. We'll be fine.
<string>I heard Yomogi's Bunny Dango<lf>were on the verge of running out.
<string>We know the merchant who was attacked.<lf>He usually brings the ingredients used<lf>to make the dango.
<string>He's a brave one, doing his job<lf>even with the Rampage going on.<lf>A true merchant.
<string>Oh my, I musn't flatter him too much.<lf>Wouldn't want Senari getting jealous.
<string>I hear something strange is going on<lf>at the Shrine Ruins. Ghosts is it?
<string>It's actually a lovely place, but with<lf>so many monsters around, any ghosts<lf>that might've been there probably left.
<string>So, about this Rampage, then. Us two<lf>will take care of the Stronghold's<lf>meals, which we're preparing now.
<string>Some people say the quality of the food<lf>isn't important in an emergency...<lf>But I don't agree with that.
<string>Tough times need good food more<lf>than ever! Staying strong's harder<lf>without proper nutrition.
<string>And that's where we come in.<lf>Alrighty, time to make 'em<lf>and take 'em!
<string>Huh... I honestly didn't account<lf>for Elder Fugen's and Hinoa's<lf>seemingly neverending appetites.
<string>The food stores were gone in minutes!<lf>Well, since the battle was over so<lf>quickly, I suppose it's no matter.
<string>And I bet we have you to thank for that,<lf>so thank you, <PL>!
<string>After you brought back those Bishaten<lf>parts, Master Hamon had his device<lf>done in no time.
<string>We knew he'd get hungry while he was<lf>working, so we brought him some food.<lf>Then he came in the other day...
<string>And thanked us with a bow and the words,<lf>"Your food was crucial to the completion<lf>of my device." *sigh* What a gentleman!
<string><PL>, you're really<lf>hunting Magnamalo, are you?
<string>Hope you're full, stomach-wise.<lf>Gotta have something in there<lf>to make the best out of a hunt!
<string>I heard Elder Fugen gave you that<lf>special sword of his, <PL>.
<string>It's been in Kamura for generations, but<lf>no one really knows anything about it.<lf>Is it really all that special, then?
<string>When we were last at the Stronghold,<lf>I saw Elder Fugen cutting meat with it,<lf>so wash it before using it, at least.
<string>My husband and I are going to defend<lf>this shop until things are safer around<lf>here.
<string>Having said that, we don't feel particularly<lf>unsafe. Must be because everyone here<lf>has faith in you.
<string>We're all counting on you, <PL>.<lf>Oh, and make sure to eat plenty no matter<lf>how busy you are, OK?
<string>Ah, <PL>. I heard you started<lf>taking quests at the Gathering Hub.
<string>The canteen in the Hub has the same menu<lf>as Yomogi's, but with a lighter taste.
<string>We do provide them with the same<lf>ingredients, though, so maybe that's<lf>down to the atmosphere of the place.
<string>I hear the canteen is busy with<lf>all those hunting groups over there.
<string>The only reason they're managing<lf>to handle the huge spike in orders<lf>is because of Otemai's hard work.
<string>She's far from a pushover, though.<lf>Otemai has some spunk, so take<lf>care to avoid setting her off!

<string>Word around the village is a horde's<lf>approaching. A big one too, led by<lf>an Apex monster.
<string>My husband and I are going to do<lf>all we can—which is, of course,<lf>satisfying everyone's stomachs.
<string>Our iron bond as citizens of Kamura<lf>will get us through this, I know it.
<string>Gosh, I didn't expect Hinoa to bond<lf>with a monster. I hope she's OK.
<string>We'll have to find and defeat the beast<lf>quickly before Minoto falls ill herself<lf>worrying for her sister.
<string>Gosh, I didn't expect Hinoa to bond<lf>with a monster. I hope she's OK.
<string>We'll have to find and defeat the beast<lf>quickly before Minoto falls ill herself<lf>worrying for her sister.
<string>So, the Rampage is caused by<lf>the monster that Hinoa bonded with?
<string>What was its name... Ibushi?<lf>I never knew a monster could<lf>have such terrifying power.
<string>All the more reason for us to stop it,<lf>for both Kamura's and Hinoa's sakes.
<string>The Wind Serpent's finally<lf>been sighted again, huh?
<string>And the Stronghold's defenders will<lf>lure it out, after which you'll take it<lf>down once and for all?
<string>Sounds like one difficult job. We<lf>better prepare something even<lf>more nutritious this time around.
<string>The Rampage hasn't stopped,<lf>even after Ibushi's defeat...
<string>Still, I'm glad Hinoa's feeling better.<lf>I think everyone can agree that<lf>that's the most important thing.
<string>If the Rampage comes again,<lf>we'll just do the same thing—<lf>maybe there's a second Ibushi.
<string>We'll just find it and hunt it,<lf>and that'll be the end of it!<lf>...Well, IF we can find it.
<string>Minoto can "resonate" just like Hinoa...<lf>Must be because they're twins.
<string>So, if Narwa was defeated too,<lf>the Rampage would end, wouldn't it?
<string>That must be why Minoto's using<lf>their connection to try and find<lf>its location. I hope she succeeds!
<string>It's time, isn't it? Your weapon and<lf>armor good to go? Haven't forgotten<lf>any items, have you?
<string>Well, if you've got everything, have<lf>a hearty meal, and stay safe out there!
<string>Hinoa and Minoto resonating at once...<lf>That means both serpents still live.
<string>That's worrying, but don't beat yourself up<lf>over it. You did all you could.
<string>Getting down in the dumps won't solve<lf>anything. We just need to eat proper,<lf>and wait for the next chance to strike.

<string>Oh, <PL>. Heading out?<lf>Do you have everything you need?
<string>...Alright, looking good! Well, second<lf>to my darling husband, obviously.
<string>Anyway, I won't keep you any longer.<lf>Do be careful now, you hear?
<string>With the Rampage tapering off, I think<lf>Kamura's going to be a little more<lf>lively now, just like it used to be.
<string>My husband's quite thrilled about the<lf>prospect—I mean, look at how excited<lf>he is. Isn't it the dreamiest thing?
<string>Anyway, it's all because of you! So thank<lf>you, <PL>, ever so much.
<string>My husband holes up in the back room<lf>whenever he's coming up with a new dish.
<string>Then, when he does think of one,<lf>we make it and have Hamon try it.

<string>Yomogi, from the Tea Shop often stops by<lf>our store to buy all sorts of ingredients.
<string>It's so she can experiment with new<lf>dango recipes. Quite the culinary<lf>scientist, isn't she?
<string>You know, whenever her experiments go<lf>wrong, I actually feel kind of guilty,<lf>even though it's not our fault...

<string>Hi, <PL>,<lf>I hope you're eating well!
<string>A hunter's body is everything to them,<lf>and you can only fuel it with good food.
<string>Take, for example, my wonderful husband.
<string>His energy, sweetness, and handsomeness—<lf>they're all thanks to eating hearty meals.
