<string>Well, punch a pretzel! THE Kamura Hunter.<lf>Pleased to meetcha! Everyone's been goin'<lf>and on about cha! And now I see why!
<string>Just look at those muscles! Finally! A REAL<lf>hunter! That pipsqueak with the red mop<lf>wishes he had half the bulk you got... Ha!
<string>Well, I'm just itchin' to see if everything<lf>they've been sayin' about you is true!<lf>Don't go disappointin' us now, OK?
<string>Well, stir my stew. Look at that gear!<lf>You've been dancin' with some big boys,<lf>haven't cha!?
<string>Judging by your demeanor, I bet you're not<lf>afraid of anything. I bet you could walk right<lf>up to a Khezu and kick it in the kisser. Ha!
<string>You must have some amazing stories.<lf>Whenever you get some time, I'd love<lf>to hear some of 'em!
<string>Whaaat, leavin' already? You JUST got here!
<string>Well, I guess you can't crush monsters if<lf>you're stuck here. Trust me I know. Well,<lf>see ya when ya get back!
<string>Well, smack a Rath, <PL>'s back!<lf>Everyone's been waitin' for ya! They're<lf>all excited to see you do your thing!
<string>And me too! Can't wait to see you up to<lf>your shins in monster guts! Just don't go<lf>sprainin' anything, y'hear?
<string>"The Three Lords," y'say? Well, stir my stew,<lf>this is gonna be good!
<string>Any hunter worth their salt would be<lf>foamin' at the mouth for a chance to go up<lf>against one of those bad boys. I know I am!
<string>If you ask me, monsters are monsters,<lf>no matter where they hatch.
<string>Don't give two figs what popped up where,<lf>or what the Guild has to say—I'm just<lf>here to throw down with big bruisers!
<string>Let me at those monsters! I'm ready<lf>to hunt!
<string>I need to see how these biceps stack<lf>up against those big boys!
<string>FINALLY, an order from the Admiral<lf>himself! Joinin' up with the research<lf>team was worth it after all!
<string>Alriiight, just you wait, Kingdom<lf>monsters! You and those Big<lf>Three better look out for me!
<string>Pffft, he got himself lost in the Flooded<lf>Forest!? And he's supposed to be the<lf>smart one? Ha!
<string>But don't worry 'bout him too much.<lf>He ain't much of a fighter, but he can<lf>outrun darn near anything out there.
<string>Hohoho, you can feel it, right? We're<lf>inchin' closer and closer to those<lf>Three Lords!
<string>You know what? Think I'll pop out on<lf>a quest and do a li'l investigatin' myself!
<string>Sure wish I was in your shoes... I spent<lf>a whole quest lookin' for that Garangolm<lf>and didn't even catch a whiff of it!
<string>When you get back you better tell me<lf>every single li'l detail about it, OK!?<lf>Promise? PINKY SWEAR!?
<string>So I heard all about that Garangolm.<lf>Now that's my kinda monster! I gotta<lf>hunt me one! And best believe I will! 
<string>By the way, Hunter. You got up close and<lf>personal with it, right? Which, uh, one of<lf>us you think has the bigger biceps, huh?
<string>You're out there findin' new monsters<lf>to bash and I'm stuck here selling stew!<lf>I'm so mad I gonna punch a— *ahem*
<string>No big deal. Don't matter who finds 'em<lf>just as long as I get to hunt 'em!
<string>I barged my way into Bahari's lab and<lf>grabbed an eyeful of them creepy<lf>things he's got in there...
<string>But y'know, it's the strangest thing...<lf>The longer I gaped at it, the cuter I<lf>thought it was.
<string>Is my noggin, OK? Maybe I need a nap<lf>or somethin'...
<string>Lunagaron, huh? If you're not careful,<lf>those things'll take your head clean off!<lf>THAT'S my kinda monster!
<string>And if Qurio are ampin' 'em up—hoo<lf>boy—that's gonna be one heck of a ride!
<string>All three Lords showed up quicker than<lf>I coulda expected! How's a gal supposed<lf>to stay calm, here!?
<string>I can hardly keep it together, here...<lf>Between maintainin' my gear and<lf>preppin' traps, things have gotten busy!
<string>I know it's not the type of thing to be all<lf>giddy about but Malzeno ain't your garden-<lf>variety monster! Better get myself ready!
<string>And that goes for all of us! If Malzeno can<lf>drop in on us out of nowhere we gotta be<lf>ready for it when it does!
<string>There ain't nothing we can do at this point,<lf>I get that.
<string>Still, you feel it too, don'tcha? That<lf>frustration rollin' around inside ya?<lf>I tell ya, I'm so frustrated I could punch—
<string>No. We ain't got time for bein' frustrated.<lf>We need to focus on what's important. And<lf>what's important is takin' down Malzeno!
<string>Otherwise, what's the point of us even<lf>bein' here!?
<string>Heck yeah, Elgado's finally back up and<lf>runnin'! Love to see it—everyone rollin'<lf>up their sleeves and gettin' to work!
<string>I'd say it's about time to show that<lf>Malzeno punk what we're capable of!
<string>Well, punch a pretzel, you took down<lf>Malzeno! Now THAT's what I call huntin'!<lf>Good work, <PL>!
<string>Still, even with that big boy outta the<lf>way, the Qurio ain't lettin' up... Guess<lf>there's still some fun to be had, huh!?
<string>Somethin's been buggin' me: how can<lf>those Qurio keep flyin' around, with<lf>Malzeno gone? Am I missin' something?
<string>Welp, mysteries like that are all the more<lf>reason for some good ol' fashion investigatin'.<lf>Maybe I'll venture out myself!
<string>If there's a chance the Qurio got themselves<lf>a new boss, what kinda monster would it be,<lf>I wonder?
<string>I guess it could just be another Malzeno,<lf>but I don't know... Guess we'll just have<lf>to wait and see, huh?
<string>The Archdemon of the Abyss, huh? If we<lf>can figure out what that monster's all about,<lf>everything up to now might come together.
<string>And don't you worry about Elgado. We got<lf>it covered! Even if the Qurio make their<lf>way here, they'll have me to deal with!
<string>Woo! I'm ready to crush some monsters!<lf>Just let 'em even try to step foot in Elgado!
<string>So I heard the research team's gonna<lf>keep doin' their mission here. I gotta<lf>tell ya, I ain't mad about it!
<string>You'd never see monsters like this<lf>anywhere else! For a hunter like me,<lf>this is THE place to be!
<string>And I know you feel the same! There's still<lf>plenty of monsters that need smackin'<lf>around, am I right? You know I am!
<string>The Kingdom calls this outpost an<lf>"observation base," but I don't know<lf>who they're tryin' to kid.
<string>I mean, the only thing I came out here<lf>to observe is monsters gettin' smacked<lf>around.
<string>And now that we got THE Kamura Hunter<lf>here, I'm definitely gonna be observin' your<lf>work! After the shop closes, of course...
<string>Well, punch a pretzel, that's some<lf>fine gear ya got there! I like your style!
<string>You an' me got similar tastes, ya know?<lf>The next time ya forge something, come<lf>show me, I'd love to see it!
<string>Those Wirebugs o' yours are some<lf>lively critters. Oh, I can tell: the buzz<lf>of their wings gives it away!
<string>I guess the ones you raise in Kamura<lf>are a different breed after all. I'd love<lf>to get my hands on a couple!
<string>So the monsters 'round here really have<lf>been more aggressive! Well, punch a<lf>pretzel, I knew it wasn't my imagination!
<string>I tell ya, there's plenty of folks 'round here<lf>terrified of that fact, but not me! The meaner<lf>they are, the harder I get to hit 'em! Bwaha!
<string>That hometown of yours, Kamura Village.<lf>They're famous for steelwork, ain't they?<lf>Now that's something!
<string>Once things've chilled out 'round here,<lf>I wanna go get a weapon made! You'll<lf>lead the way for me, won'tcha?
<string>Well, stir my stew, look at you! That gear<lf>you've got on! I see what you're doin'!
<string>Ain't pickin' mushrooms in that get up!<lf>You're goin' after them big boys! You look<lf>like you're after a new set of boots! Ha!
<string>We're a coupla peas inna pod, you and<lf>me! Next time I need some new gear,<lf>I know who I'm gonna talk to!
<string>Let's talk bugs! Great Wirebugs!
<string>Well, punch a pretzel! It's <PL>!<lf>You been makin' good use of those <COLS RED>Great<lf>Wirebugs</COL>?
<string>They sure do come in handy, don't they?<lf>Crazy how that super-strong thread of theirs<lf>lets you fly all over the map!
<string>And they love their Jewel Lilies, don't they?<lf>Once one has made itself comfy in a patch,<lf>it ain't goin' nowhere!
<string>Whoever thought up usin' these things for<lf>transportation must've been a genius...<lf>and a li'l bit out of their mind! Hahaha!
<string>Anyway, sorry for the tangent but I caught<lf>me some and I thought maybe you'd get more<lf>use out of 'em than I would. Here ya go!
<string>If you spot some Jewel Lilies, chuck one<lf>in there and you'll be able to use it anytime<lf>you come across it!
<string>Let's talk bugs! Great Wirebugs!
<string>Well, smack a Rath! It's <PL>!<lf>Heard you've been doin' your thing out<lf>there! Good for you!
<string>Well, I caught ya some more Great Wirebugs<lf>so you can keep doin' it! Enjoy!
<string>Hey, check this out!
<string>Well, punch a pretzel, that's some good<lf>timin'! I need your help with something!
<string>Got a weird request to take a picture of<lf>a Daimyo Hermitaur usin' their claws<lf>as a shield.
<string>Thing is, I'm awful at takin' pics. I can<lf>barely take one standin' still much less<lf>in the middle of a hunt!
<string>Ya gotta help me out here. If you do,<lf>I've got some Great Wirebugs with<lf>your name on 'em!
<string>Well, look at that!
<string>Well, smack a Rath! Look at that shot!<lf>Great work there, Hunter! I'm sure my<lf>client'll be plenty pleased with it!
<string>You know, this might sound crazy...<lf>But the way that silly crab's posin'—<lf>it's, uh, kinda cute, don't you think?
<string>Makes you almost feel sorry for 'em.<lf>Ha! ALMOST! Hahaha! Thanks again!
<string>Yo! Can I holler at you for a sec?
<string>Well, punch a pretzel, <PL>!<lf>Great timin'! I got another photo op<lf>for ya! This one comes from Bahari.
<string>You've tangled with a Garangolm, right? You<lf>know how it has those crazy arms? One gets<lf>all explody and the other gets all mossy?
<string>Yeah, Bahari wants a picture of that...but<lf>at the same time...and like, when you're<lf>huntin' it. I know, I know. It's a tall order!
<string>But if there's anyone who can do it, it's<lf>you! And if you do it, I got a whole mess<lf>of Great Wirebugs with your name on 'em!
<string>Well, look at that!
<string>Great eye you've got, <PL>!<lf>You can see everything, clear as day.<lf>Bahari's sure to be pleased with this!
<string>Although I'm not sure what he wants it<lf>for. Best to stay out of his crazy head.<lf>I'm not much of a thinker myself!
<string>Leavin' them picture shoots to you was<lf>a good idea. I'm more suited to just hittin'<lf>things 'til they die! Ha! Thanks again!
