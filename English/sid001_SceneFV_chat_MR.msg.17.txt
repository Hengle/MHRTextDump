<string>Exemplary job. Today<lf>was time well spent.
<string>Knights must not falter.<lf>Today was a big step forward.
<string>I've learned so much from you<lf>today. Let's recap later.
<string>We don't know what lies ahead.<lf>Let's keep our wits about us.
<string>No large monsters in the area,<lf>but it's best to stay alert.
<string>I must train so that my focus<lf>waxes, yet never wanes.
<string>Ha, don't say that, Admiral! You must give<lf>the young knights something to aspire to!
<string>I expected the best from Kamura's hero,<lf>of course, but I believe you've improved!
<string>I appreciate your encouraging<lf>words, Admiral! I'll keep at it!
<string>Don't say that in front of the hunter!<lf>You've a reputation to uphold!
<string>Master Arlow, you were<lf>just as brilliant as ever.
<string>I'm fine, thanks. I have fulfilled my<lf>duty with honor. That is all that matters.
<string>It's not necessary to apologize. You have<lf>fulfilled your duty, that is all that matters.
<string>And the more people you can go hunting<lf>with, the more you can improve!
<string>I must say I'm impressed.<lf>Your training is really paying off, Jae.
<string>It's not just about strength, you brute!<lf>You must focus on skill, as well!
<string>Well done, Rondine. I must say,<lf>your ability still surpasses my own.
<string>Well done today. However, there<lf>is still room for improvement.
<string>Let us recap, once we return.
