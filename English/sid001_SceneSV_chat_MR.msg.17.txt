<string>I'm looking forward<lf>to a productive time.
<string>No matter a quest's goal,<lf>knights always do their best.
<string>I'm well equipped for today.<lf>How are your preparations?
<string>Thank you for joining me. It's<lf>a joy to be in your company.
<string>May our invaluable time<lf>together bear fruit.
<string>How nice of you to join me<lf>again. You have my gratitude.
<string>I'm inspired by your<lf>tireless work ethic.
<string>I just couldn't help but notice<lf>you seem to be in awful good spirits.
<string>You'd better buckle up<lf>for a wild ride, <PL>...
<string>To imagine YOU as a trader.<lf>Ha! How did you pull that off?
<string>Ha! I believe it was they who<lf>were fooling YOU, dear sister!
<string>Looks like you're ready to get out<lf>there, <PL>.
<string>Admiral, we must not fall behind!
<string>Roger that, Admiral!
<string>I can't remember the last time<lf>we hunted together, Admiral.
<string>Brace yourself, <PL>.<lf>It's going to be a bumpy ride.
<string>Oh, Admiral Galleus, our report<lf>to the capital is due today...
<string>But, Admiral... What if—!?
<string>It's an honor to hunt with<lf>you today, Master Arlow.
<string>Shall I report you for abandoning<lf>your duties?
<string>Ha! Look at you forgetting I'm not<lf>just your student anymore!
<string>It's rather rare these days to see<lf>you out in the field, Master Arlow.
<string>Is that so? The young knights<lf>will be pleased to hear it.
<string>Calm yourself, Luchika.<lf>Remember last time...? 
<string>Perhaps you can tone it down<lf>a little this time...?
<string>No need to rush, Luchika. The<lf>monsters aren't going anywhere.
<string>...Oh. Sorry.
<string>Calm yourself before I show you<lf>how close you are to a beating!
<string>It's good that you're motivated,<lf>but don't rush in on your own.
<string>You have talent, I'll give you that,<lf>but be aware of your surroundings.
<string>Today you should try keeping up<lf>with <PL>.
<string>*sigh* These new techniques of yours<lf>always end up with me saving your hide!
<string>Please not this time...<lf>I have a bad feeling about this.
<string>With you here, Rondine, I feel<lf>like I can relax a bit.
<string>Well, I can only let my guard down<lf>so much in front of my little sister.
<string>I take it Chino and Kotori<lf>are doing well?
<string>Of course! And I'm just dying<lf>to see your merchant routine!
<string>This is an important moment.<lf>Let's give it our all!
