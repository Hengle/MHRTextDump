<string>Today you'll catch a glimpse<lf>of what I'm made of.
<string>Don't drag your feet and make<lf>me do all the hard work, yeah?
<string>You all set for today's quest?<lf>Got everything you need?
<string>What's the matter? A leader is<lf>supposed to ask these things!
<string>Time for a bit of fun, yeah?
<string>Don't worry, I'll lend a hand<lf>when the goin' gets tough.
<string>Here you are! Guess that means<lf>we can get started!
<string>Can't wait to see what kind<lf>of spoils are in store for us!
<string>Same as last time,<lf>no slouchin' today.
<string>Should be a cinch<lf>for someone like you!
<string>What I'm really huntin' today<lf>are the rewards, so let's go!
<string>Nothin' wrong with that, eh?<lf>Got some coming your way, too!
<string>This is gonna be a tough one, yeah?
<string>But tough or not, there's<lf>nothing like a good challenge!
<string>Alright, Hunter!<lf>Let's see what you can do!
<string>Some things don't change, yeah?<lf>You still don't talk much.
<string>Well somebody's gotta hold up<lf>your end of the conversation.
<string>Wouldn't want it to get<lf>awkward for <PL>.
<string>Don't get your hopes up, yeah?<lf>I ain't what I used to be...
<string>But since <PL>'s here,<lf>guess I'll put in some effort, yeah?
<string>With you two here, guess<lf>I can take it easy, yeah?
<string>Look at you tryin' to pull rank<lf>on your ol' master.
<string>A certain enthusiastic instructor inspired<lf>me to come out of retirement, yeah?
<string>Oi, <PL>.<lf>What's with the geezer get together?
<string>Galleus you're a little old<lf>for this kinda thing, yeah?
<string>I'll show you who's an old timer!
<string>It appears the flames of Kamura<lf>have "lit a fire under me," yeah?
<string>We can't let our young friend here<lf>have all the fun, can we?
<string>Maybe we can have a bit of fun<lf>if Galleus doesn't slow us down, yeah?
<string>Feel free to take a break if you<lf>start feeling tired, ol' man.
<string>Some of the young knights are<lf>intimidated by you, yeah?
<string>Not sure what all the fuss is about.<lf>Just as long as you're focused.
<string>You two ready for a little fun, yeah?
<string>Alright, <PL>. Let's<lf>go out and hurt some monsters!
<string>You'll burn yourself out if you<lf>keep up this pace, slow it down.
<string>Uh... You wanna talk about this now?<lf>Right in front of 'em?
<string>No, no! It's not like that!<lf>Your "Ace" is doin' just fine...
<string>It's just not my style to be handing<lf>out compliments mid-hunt, yeah?
<string>Oi, Utsushi. What've you been<lf>doing when visiting Elgado?
<string>You got a good teacher,<lf><PL>.
<string>Your answer is good enough,<lf>innit Utsushi?
