<string>Welcome to the Training Area!<lf>Here you can hone your skills<lf>to your heart's content!
<string>If you're into melee combat, hit up the<lf>Toadversary! Literally! Or if ranged<lf>weapons are more your fur-te...
<string>Wait... Why am I telling you this!? You've been<lf>coming here to purr-actice for ages meow.<lf>Well, I guess a little refresher never hurts!
<string>Anymew, drop by whenever you're feeling<lf>a little rusty or when you wanna try out<lf>somethin' new without endin' up on a cart.
<string>The Training Area was originally for<lf>hunters and hunter-aspirants to come<lf>train, but lots of non-hunters come too.
<string>Ever since the Rampage fifty years ago,<lf>even regular people realized that they<lf>needed to be able to wield a weapon.
<string>So, keep training, <PL>!<lf>Anyone could be a rival for best warrior<lf>in Kamura!
<string><PL>, I heard you encountered<lf>Magnameowlo.
<string>Magnameowlo showed up some fifty<lf>years ago too. I heard about it from<lf>Meowster Hamon and Kogarashi.
<string>I wasn't even a kitten yet then,<lf>so I haven't seen it fur myself, but...
<string>Whenever those two talk about it, their<lf>expressions get so grim all of a sudden.<lf>Sends chills down my whiskers...
<string><PL>!<lf>Great work meow-t there!
<string>You taking down Magnameowlo really<lf>shows the fur-uits of your training!
<string>Don't stop now, keep it up:<lf>Eat, sleep, train! Eat, sleep, train!
<string>"Take it from <PL>,<lf>Slayer of Ibushi:
<string>'It would not have been pawssible to<lf>achieve the power I have now had<lf>it not been for the Training Area.'"
<string>I can see it meow on billboards everywhere...<lf>Think the Guild would go fur it? It'd be<lf>purr-etty neat if they did!
<string>"Take it from<lf><PL>, Slayer of Narwa:
<string>When I slew the Thunder Serpent, in<lf>the back of my mind were thoughts of my<lf>daily exertions in the Training Area.'"
<string>I can see it meow in magazines everywhere...<lf>Think the Guild would go fur it? It'd be<lf>purr-etty neat if they did!
<string>I've never met a hunter as meowtivated as you<lf>be-furr! You come in here and train your tail<lf>off despite everything you've already done!
<string>I wish more hunters were more like you,<lf><PL>...
<string>If there were, then Kamura would have<lf>an unstoppable army of super-hunters!<lf>The meownsters would be scared of US!
<string>So you're gonna go paw-to-paw<lf>with Narwa and Ibushi, huh?<lf>Go get 'em, Tigrex!
<string>You've been training here day<lf>and night, sun or shine, fur longer<lf>than you've even been a hunter.
<string>So put those skills to work! All that<lf>training is sure to pay off!
<string>Hey, <PL>! Come to purr-actice<lf>your mew-ves?
<string>Even after saving Kamura from calamity<lf>and becoming a big-shot hero, you don't<lf>slack at all, do ya?
<string>A-meow-zing! I'll have to follow in your<lf>tracks!
<string>The Training Area was originally for<lf>hunters and hunter-aspirants to come<lf>train, but lots of non-hunters come too.
<string>Ever since the Rampage fifty years ago,<lf>even the villagers realized that they<lf>needed to be able to wield a weapon.
<string>So, keep training, <PL>!<lf>Anyone could be a rival for best warrior<lf>in Kamura!
<string>This Training Area is a time-honored<lf>facility as old as Kamura itself.
<string>Kogarashi says Meowster Hamon,<lf>Meowster Hojo, and Elder Fugen<lf>used to train here back in the day!
<string>To think, the very same spot where<lf>Meowster Hamon first took up a light<lf>bowgun...
<string>Is where you, <PL>,<lf>wield your weapons now.<lf>Isn't that cool!?
<string>Lately, Meowster Utsushi has been<lf>coming here to purr-actice his<lf>meownster impurr-essions.
<string>He said, "People might think there's a<lf>real Zingore around if I do it in town,<lf>so I'm gonna have do it here instead!"
<string>This place wasn't really meant for<lf>stuff like that, but what the heck.<lf>Fur one thing, it's neat to see!
<string>Apparently, a long time ago, this place<lf>was just filled with rows of log posts<lf>and straw bundles.
<string>According to Kogarashi, everyone would<lf>try their cutting edges against them and<lf>work towards meowstery of their form.
<string>And then Meowster Hamon built<lf>the Toadversary.
<string>With the Toadversary's introduction, the<lf>Training Area's paw-pularity skyrocketed.<lf>Meowster Hamon is incredible!
<string>Meowster Hamon comes here<lf>regularly to purr-form maintenance<lf>on the Toadversary.
<string>It's a really complicated contraption<lf>full of spinning bits and moving parts<lf>that require fur-equent servicing.
<string>I do my part where I can,<lf>greasing the gears and such.
<string>Hinoa and Minoto come here<lf>to train a lot, too.
<string>When Minoto comes to train, she goes all<lf>in, barely stopping to catch a breath.
<string>Hinoa, on the other hand, mostly<lf>sits there, smiling and snacking on<lf>dango, watching her sister.
<string>But when she takes up her bow, she'll<lf>hit the bullseye one hundred times<lf>in a row. Her talent is uncanny!
<string>Lately I've been seeing a lot of Taishi.
<string>He wants to be a hunter so badly,<lf>he's working his little tail off to learn.
<string>He's always eager and willing to listen.<lf>I think he'll grow up to be a fine hunter<lf>one day.
<string>He looks up to you so lend him a paw<lf>if you see him meow-t here.
<string>Seihaku has been coming here with<lf>Hinoa fur bow training lately.
<string>He's still at the stage where it's the<lf>weapon handling him, and not the other<lf>way around, but he tries paw-fuly hard.
<string>Besides, Kogarashi always says:<lf>"Nothing breeds strength like the<lf>will to protect those you love..."
<string>And we all know that boy has<lf>someone he loves!
