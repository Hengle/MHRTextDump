<string>The water in these lands is pure. Clean<lf>water enriches the soil. From rich soil<lf>sprouts new life. Prayer brings water.
<string>This land was home to many a god.<lf>But they shunned people. Thus the land<lf>was only admired with envy from afar.
<string>Then, without warning, a bolt of<lf>lightning resounded through the night.<lf>When dawn broke, the gods were gone.
<string>The people began to gather in this<lf>blessed land, erecting many a shrine<lf>to venerate the departed gods.
<string>Graced by abundance, the people<lf>lived a bountiful and peaceful life,<lf>filling the land with prayers.
<string>Moons passed; times changed. The people<lf>became arrogant and thankless. As they<lf>did so, the land fell into desolation.
<string>Then, one night, a gale swept the land<lf>before halting abruptly, as though<lf>it were the breath of a divine being.
<string>In its wake appeared the gods, thought<lf>to have vanished. Terrified, the people<lf>fled from their ire.
<string>The people begged for clemency,<lf>but the deities raged regardless,<lf>chasing the mortals away.
<string>Time devoured the peoples' shrines and<lf>prayers; but eventually, pure water and<lf>rich soil returned to nurture new life.
<string>After many a long year on the high seas,<lf>the ship's harpoon reduced the dragon to<lf>naught but a sinking berg on the waves.
<string>The crew of veteran soldiers, their duty<lf>fulfilled, moored alongside a snowy<lf>shore, quiet save for the lapping tide.
<string>But their ship, fatally scathed, split<lf>in two; the men resigned themselves to<lf>a Pyrrhic victory and uneasy morrows.
<string>"Day 1: We awoke to a pale shore marred<lf>by claw marks and signs of battle.<lf>Someone said they heard a lullaby."
<string>"Day 2: Our scouts returned without<lf>their weapons, claiming they saw a shadow<lf>dragging a bloody knife behind them."
<string>"Day 3: We all hid in the ship,<lf>shivering not from cold, but fear.<lf>Some whisper that the isle is cursed."
<string>"Day 10: Before we knew it, there were<lf>monsters everywhere, scratching at the<lf>ship's hull. Howls and panic followed."
<string>"Day 16: The beasts' feast was at an<lf>end, as were any courage or valiance<lf>we once-noble warriors had possessed."
<string>What had summoned those monsters were<lf>the very remains of that mighty wyvern,<lf>growing in strength even after defeat.
<string>Mayhaps it was a curse. Neither the ship<lf>nor the bones will tell, for they have<lf>long disappeared into the marine snow.
<string>Long ago, a Felyne came to the Flooded<lf>Forest seeking a giant fish of lore, but<lf>he was tailed by a meddlesome Melynx.
<string>When the Felyne wasn't looking, the<lf>Melynx snatched his bags, leaving him<lf>with nothing but a single piece of meat.
<string>Defeated, the Felyne collapsed in<lf>frustration, when he realized that there<lf>was a hungry snake right under his nose.
<string>The Felyne tore off some meat for the<lf>snake, and it hissed happily, "Feed<lf>the ssstream, and it will feed you."
<string>Confused, the Felyne nevertheless threw<lf>his last morsel into the stream. Then,<lf>suddenly...thousands of fish appeared!
<string>It was not the mythic creature he'd<lf>sought, but he was delighted anyway,<lf>and filled his pockets to the brim.
<string>The greedy Melynx, seeing this, said to<lf>itself: "If I throw in a bunch, I'll get<lf>even MORE fish back for myself!"
<string>He gathered a heap of meat, and tossed<lf>it all in... Only to be greeted by the<lf>gaping maw of the legendary giant fish!
<string>The Melynx took one look at that monster<lf>and fled for its life, dropping the<lf>Felyne's belongings in the process.
<string>And so, having seen the fabled fish, the<lf>Felyne thanked his serpentine friend and<lf>set off in search of new adventures.
<string>There was an old hunter, long separated<lf>from his hometown, who yearned to<lf>reunite with those he had left behind.
<string>Despite his old age, he persisted in<lf>heaving his aching muscles and ragged<lf>bones forward, one step after another.
<string>A map showed that his village was just<lf>over the horizon, but an unfamiliar<lf>wasteland sprawled between him and it.
<string>Barely escaping the hungry jaws of countless<lf>monsters, he pressed on, willful that he would<lf>put this savage land behind him ere long...
<string>Several days passed with no sign of his<lf>home anywhere. He began to fear some<lf>fault in the map had led him astray.
<string>Then, finally, he came upon a path that<lf>plunged into the underbelly of the void.<lf>Shaken, uneasy, he descended it withal.
<string>This building was familiar; he knew it<lf>too well... But no wonder he couldn't<lf>find it—it'd been buried under the sand.
<string>Hoping to find something left behind,<lf>anything, he entered his old house.<lf>On the wall was written this message:
<string>"As the crimson glow falls upon us,<lf>our people flee this land; but I promise<lf>to survive, that we two may reunite."
<string>And so the old hunter set out once more,<lf>vowing never to rest or falter, as he<lf>yet had a duty to his love to fulfill.
<string>"We soon embark on the first exploration<lf>of the Lava Caverns, a tract beset by<lf>crag and fire, yet laced with greenery."
<string>"Day 17: Botanic and zoologic studies<lf>have yielded no insight into the biota's<lf>survival in such an environment."
<string>"Out of the blue, I was knocked to the<lf>ground by a rumble from the earth.<lf>Mere volcanic activity, perhaps...?"
<string>"Day 19: For every effect, there must be<lf>a cause. After a day of observation,<lf>I have identified a cycle in the tremors."
<string>"This phenomenon simply cannot be self-<lf>supported. I hypothesize that it is the<lf>creation of someone...or something."
<string>"Day 38: The pulse intensifies! I must<lf>curb my passion and make ready to begin<lf>field work; the source awaits me."
<string>"Day 39: We are in danger. All at once,<lf>monsters have appeared in droves. They<lf>are vicious—the camp is no longer safe."
<string>"The hunters have advised me to vacate.<lf>Unfortunately, it seems I must abandon<lf>the investigation if I am to survive..."
<string>"The pulse and this anomaly may be related,<lf>but I have no way to corroborate that<lf>now. Further research is impossible."
<string>"If someone out there would continue my<lf>research, venture into the beach cave.<lf>The answer should be there."
<string>We were raised in a peaceful village.<lf>The pure wind chased out evil and the<lf>calm flames illuminated our path.
<string>But one night, a dark cloud descended,<lf>blotting out the sun, and we were beset<lf>by savage tempests and feral lightning.
<string>Recalling ancient tales of the calamity,<lf>we sang in supplication: "Fearsome<lf>gales, be still! We beg of you!"
<string>For we faced the terrible Rampage: an<lf>eternal cycle of misfortune; that which<lf>flattens forests and scatters rivers.
<string>Tasked by the elder, we hunters stood<lf>fast: arms at the ready, spirits high,<lf>steeled to fend off the calamity.
<string>And as the fury of the Rampage fell upon<lf>us, our priestesses prayed, "Sacred<lf>flames, guide us in our time of need!"
<string>But alas, our defenses fell, one after<lf>another. And then, the hellfire beast<lf>attacked, sealing our defeat.
<string>Flames quenched and hopes dashed,<lf>I doubted if I was truly fit to carry<lf>the sword given to me by the elder.
<string>Yet my pledge to restore the village<lf>became my guiding light. Our legacy<lf>was strong, and I was not alone.
<string>It is a burden that I now gladly bear—<lf>I shall lead this village and its people<lf>to new refuge from the Rampage.
