<string>Help... Please!
<string>I know this is sudden, but I've got<lf>something important to discuss. Bugs.<lf>*cringe*
<string>Minayle has come up with a way to<lf>upgrade a certain heavy bowgun, but<lf>she needs some squishy samples.
<string>I-I could go capture them myself, but I'm,<lf>like, super busy. Super, SUPER busy.<lf>Definitely not because I hate bugs!
<string>So, yeah. This is a very important task!<lf>You want better weapons? Go catch<lf>some bugs!
<string>Thank you so much!
<string>Thanks for helping out on such short<lf>notice. You really are aiding weapon<lf>development here. Be proud! Boast a bit!
<string>Now you can push that insect weapon<lf>to the insectoid max. If you're interested,<lf>go check out the Smithy. I won't be!
<string>(Fiorayne can't touch bugs, can she?<lf>I bet she can't. She can't, so I can't!)<lf>Wait— Did you hear that? Nnnngh!
<string>I agreed with Fiorayne's plan to bring in<lf>skilled hunters like yourself instead of<lf>more researchers.
<string>That's because Lady Fiorayne understands<lf>there are already enough good researchers<lf>here, which means she trusts me.
<string>Sorry for not introducing myself sooner,<lf>I'm Culan. So you're this skilled hunter<lf>from Kamura? Pleasure to meet you!
<string>I took a look at your data. I admire you for<lf>risking your life to protect your homeland<lf>and for making so many discoveries.
<string>I'm sorry to say we aren't strong enough to<lf>fight monsters directly. That's why we rely<lf>on you hunters and The Order.
<string>But our strengths lie elsewhere, more<lf>specifically in our research. That is<lf>where we can be of some help.
<string>If you're heading out there again I'd<lf>appreciate it if you could let Rondine<lf>know that there is no need to worry.
<string>We'll keep an eye on Lady Fiorayne<lf>to make sure she doesn't work herself<lf>too hard.
<string>Welcome back. I know, it's not as easy<lf>as it sounds traveling back and forth<lf>like this.
<string>Even if I was given time off I don't think<lf>I would return to the Kingdom. I'd rather<lf>stay here and work.
<string>It appears The Order is taking an interest<lf>in you. They're no doubt wondering if<lf>you're as good as people say you are...
<string>Of course I have little reason to worry.<lf>If Fiorayne trusts you, then I trust you.

<string>I fear Fiorayne may be pushing herself<lf>too hard. Surely she knows the difference<lf>between dedication and obsessiveness.
<string>Don't get me wrong, that's a fine line<lf>many of us struggle to differentiate.<lf>Especially us researchers...
<string>We throw ourselves into our work with little<lf>to no regard for our own well-being. But it's<lf>not the way to live! That goes for you, too!
<string>I see you've caught wind of the Three Lords.<lf>If you discover their tracks, it means they<lf>are likely to appear in the area.
<string>With that in mind stay vigilant. Stay<lf>calm and let's work together to solve<lf>each problem one at a time.
<string>The guy you're going to rescue,<lf>happens to be our boss.
<string>Some say he acts erratic, but surely there's<lf>a reason for him going out there. There must<lf>be some method to his madness...
<string>......<lf>...Right?<lf>Anyway, please, PEASE help him!
<string>It's good to see you back safe and sound.<lf>I was kinda hoping for a different outcome—<lf>Oh, no! That came out wrong!
<string>I meant I had hoped that my boss would've<lf>come back with you! I want to hurry up and<lf>solve the mystery of the Three Lords!
<string>At least before the Order does. That way<lf>I can save everyone a lot of trouble. ...And<lf>then maybe get a nice gift as thanks!
<string>I would say be careful out there, but<lf>I understand how important this<lf>mission is.
<string>Actually, I'm not worried at all. I'm pretty<lf>excited about the whole thing, because<lf>I know exactly what you're capable of!
<string>I never doubted for a second that you and<lf>Fiorayne could do it. Thanks to you two<lf>we are up to our elbows in data!
<string>I'd give you a proper thanks but I got<lf>a Monster Toughbone to pick with<lf>Bahari, first...
<string>I can't keep having him bail on us. I still<lf>have so many questions for him to answer<lf>or I'll never solve this mystery!
<string>It may be frustrating, but we can't rush our<lf>research. We have to take our time and be<lf>as thorough as possible.
<string>Luckily we found out that those mysterious<lf>little creatures have been spotted near<lf>multiple monsters...
<string>If we had jumped to conclusions about them<lf>being unique to Garangolm, we coulda lost<lf>a lot valuable time and resources!
<string>Now we just need some samples!<lf>I, uh, leave that to you...
<string>Those Qurio... Jeez. I've never seen<lf>a creature THAT ugly before... And<lf>I did my thesis on Khezu!
<string>I don't know how I feel about studying<lf>those things. At least Bahari's excited.<lf>Maybe he won't run off now...
<string>Now we're getting somewhere! Once<lf>you're done with the quest, we can start<lf>comparing data between monsters!
<string>Oh, wow! A Lunagaron! What I wouldn't<lf>give to study one of those up-close!
<string>But I don't dare get in Fiorayne's way.<lf>This mission is a big deal for her, too.
<string>We checked Fiorayne's wound, and we think<lf>she's gonna be OK. Not sure if I'm gonna<lf>be OK though. I've never been so terrified!
<string>I gotta admit, I was pretty surprised when<lf>Fiorayne of all people was wounded. Some<lf>knucklehead like Jae, sure, but Fiorayne?
<string>I'll make sure that the information you<lf>brought back will be put to good use.<lf>Leave it to us researchers!
<string><VO:SER>I can't believe what happened to Fiorayne!<lf>She was completely fine the last time<lf>I checked her...
<string>Sorry, I should be focusing on my research.<lf>This is no time to be distraught...
<string>The only thing I can do now is to try and<lf>unravel the mystery of Malzeno and the<lf>Qurio by observing and analyzing her...
<string>These are exactly the type of circumstances<lf>where we need to keep our heads...
<string>But I can't even do that...<lf>How can I when I'm freaking out!?<lf>Ugh...
<string>I'm glad that we know what we need<lf>to treat Fiorayne but in the end, there<lf>wasn't anything I could do...
<string>If we didn't have Doctor Tadori... Or you,<lf>for that matter, we would have never been<lf>able to do anything for Fiorayne.
<string>The whole situation makes me feel<lf>helpless...and useless.
<string>Before coming here, I was feeling confident.<lf>I thought all I needed was some field<lf>experience to become the best researcher.
<string>But I was wrong. There were so many<lf>things I didn't know about. So many<lf>things I never learned...
<string>And now when I think about it, none of<lf>that really matters. It seems really small<lf>of me to have been selfish like that.
<string>Especially when I think of how much poor<lf>Fiorayne has suffered... The only thing that<lf>matters right now is helping Fiorayne!
<string>There's no doubt these Espinas materials<lf>will definitely come in handy. You have<lf>our thanks!
<string>I will put my trust in Tadori and the others<lf>and focus for now on what I can do. That's<lf>the best thing I can do right now.
<string>At first, I was a little jealous of Fiorayne.<lf>Everyone was always like, "Fiorayne did<lf>this..." and "Fiorayne did that..."
<string>On one hand it drove me to be a better<lf>researcher. But on the other, I just wanted<lf>people to talk about me like that...
<string>But Fiorayne did and does all those things<lf>because she wants to protect people not<lf>because she wants their praise...
<string>So that's what I'm gonna do! I'm gonna<lf>be the best researcher, and one day, my<lf>work will protect the ones I love, too!
<string>I'm not surprised to hear that you've<lf>accomplished your mission. I never<lf>doubted you for a second.
<string>But even after all you've accomplished,<lf>I was still worried. I'm sure everyone<lf>feels the same. Or maybe not?
<string>I don't know. Maybe it's just me. I AM<lf>a bit of a worrier... Hey! What do you<lf>mean, "I can see that."!?
<string>I get the feeling that whatever the Qurio are<lf>doing out there is just the beginning...
<string>Even if Malzeno is not around, there's<lf>no tellin' what could happen.
<string>Regardless, we'll continue our work here<lf>as planned without delay. I'm sure we'll<lf>figure it out somehow.
<string>Everyone's heard of the Archdemon of<lf>the Abyss. It's an old fairy tale they tell<lf>kids to get them to eat their veggies.
<string>But just because it's a fairy tale doesn't<lf>mean it's not based on real life events.<lf>Just altered in some way.
<string>I can't be sure if this Archdemon is based<lf>on a real monster or not. I'll look into it<lf>and let you know what I discover.
<string>The Archdemon, a mythical creature said<lf>to use Qurio to gain the power of Malzeno<lf>and even other monsters...
<string>No matter how powerful it is, if it lives and<lf>breathes, then it can be hunted. Rest easy<lf>my friend, we'll come up with a way.
<string>I'm certain of this because you are<lf>the hunter that Fiorayne puts her<lf>trust in.
<string>You've already earned the respect of<lf>everyone in Elgado. That's more than<lf>enough reason to believe in you, right?
<string>Don't forget, the whole of Elgado is with<lf>you, my friend. We'll be waiting for you<lf>when you return!
<string>If you asked me a few years ago if I would<lf>be this focused and devoted to my research,<lf>I wouldn't have believed you.
<string>You not only saved the Kingdom, you<lf>also discovered many truths, and laid<lf>the foundation for future Qurio research.
<string>Your contribution is immeasurable, you have<lf>my sincere gratitude. And I look forward to<lf>working with you in the future.
<string>I joined the research team because I wanted<lf>to do something with meaning. Maybe it sounds<lf>selfish, but I'm just being honest.
<string>Of course, if it ends up benefiting you and<lf>the Kingdom, then even better. Let's work<lf>together to achieve something great.
<string>I can tell just by the look on your face,<lf>that you want some advice, right?
<string>You don't need to answer. I can tell.<lf>People always rely on me, I mean,<lf>why WOULDN'T they?
<string>I graduated top of my class, I have a lot<lf>of experience, I'm super smart— Hey! Where<lf>are you going!? I thought you needed advice!
<string>Out of all the researchers assigned here,<lf>I'm the only one who can keep up with<lf>Bahari...
<string>I'm like Bahari's right-hand, just like how<lf>Fiorayne is to the Admiral...kind of...<lf>It's totally the same thing...right?
<string>Ever since Bahari returned, we've been<lf>learning so much about the Kingdom's<lf>monsters.
<string>I can't even finish my reports on time.<lf>There's so much paperwork to do that<lf>it's piling up to the ceiling!
<string>The lab is already dangerous enough without<lf>worrying about a tower of paperwork falling<lf>over on you!
<string>How should I approach my research now?<lf>I feel like my perspective has broadened<lf>since my eyes were opened.
<string>I suppose we have Fiorayne to thank for<lf>bringing you here from Kamura.
<string>Oh—! We can't forget to thank you too,<lf>of course! Hehehe...
<string>I've been doing a lot of field work lately.<lf>I know it's dangerous, but you know what<lf>they say. Nothing ventured nothing gained!
<string>Besides, if I get used to working in the<lf>field again, they might let me go out with<lf>you and Fiorayne!
<string>I...just hope that if they do let me go out<lf>with you two that there's not another<lf>repeat of last time.
