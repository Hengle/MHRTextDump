<string><COL RED>Status icons</COL> indicating status effects<lf>are displayed to the right of your name.<lf>Status effects vary greatly; they can be<lf>positive as well as negative.
<string>You can determine a larger monster's<lf>condition by the color of the "eye-con"<lf>shown next to it on the map:<lf>- Yellow: notices the hunter and is on guard<lf>- Red: actively aggressive towards the hunter<lf>- Purple: on the move but still aggressive<lf>When a monster's health falls below a<lf>certain threshold, a blue icon will be<lf>displayed over its icon.
<string>Large monsters will eventually tire out<lf>after lots of violent activity. Tired<lf>monsters will start slobbering, move<lf>sluggishly, strike less ferociously, and<lf>become more susceptible to traps,<lf>creating openings for perceptive hunters.<lf>Keep attacking and they'll enrage,<lf>becoming faster and more dangerous.
<string>When armed with a melee weapon,<lf>a sword-shaped <COL RED>Sharpness Gauge</COL> will<lf>display on the screen.

Once<lf>upon a time, he occupied himself with<lf>hunting, his name echoing across the<lf>land...which is perhaps why he expects<lf>great things from a budding young<lf>hunter such as yourself.
<string>A female Wyverian who works as the Kamura<lf>Village quest receptionist. Her kindness<lf>and cheer illuminate the village like<lf>rays of sunshine. You've always been<lf>close; she was one of your biggest<lf>supporters during your hunter training.<lf>She's pretty much addicted to Bunny<lf>Dango, a village specialty, and can<lf>be seen buying them in bulk every day.
<string>A male Wyverian who runs a market in<lf>Kamura. Despite being a well-traveled<lf>salesman, he's taken a liking to Kamura,<lf>and treats it as his home base. Nobody<lf>knows what he actually looks like, as he<lf>keeps his face hidden behind a veil.<lf>His past is shrouded in mystery,<lf>and he seems content with that.
<string>A girl who runs the Tea Shop in Kamura.<lf>Always chipper and full of energy, she<lf>sells the village's signature dish, Bunny<lf>Dango. She never stops dreaming up<lf>new dango delicacies—even after<lf>repeated failures, she continues to<lf>strive for culinary perfection. Be sure<lf>to fill up on some delicious dango<lf>before you depart on a hunt!
<string>A man who runs the Smithy in Kamura.<lf>He says little, and focuses on his work.<lf>Though he shows scarce affection, you<lf>can tell it isn't out of malice. His forging<lf>prowess is sublime, able to turn any kind<lf>of material into works of unimaginable<lf>devastation. Whenever you need gear,<lf>find Hamon or one of his apprentices.
<string>A girl who sells candy apples. She looks<lf>up to Yomogi the Chef and does her best<lf>to emulate her. Komitsu's candy apples<lf>are famed for their exquisite sweetness<lf>almost as much as Bunny Dango are<lf>for their delectability. Kind and gracious,<lf>Komitsu does what she can to help<lf>others out. She's been friends with<lf>Seihaku from a very young age.
<string>A senior figure in Kamura whom even<lf>Fugen the Elder addresses with respect.<lf>He manages the Gathering Hub's arm<lf>of the Hunters Guild and oversees all<lf>related quests. He is always smiling,<lf>full of geriatric joviality, and often heard<lf>chuckling around the Hub. He treats<lf>you like a grandchild and has total<lf>confidence in you as a hunter.
<string>A Wyverian female who works as a<lf>receptionist at the Gathering Hub's quest<lf>counter. On the outside, she is cool and<lf>composed, but she has a warm heart and<lf>is simply shy. Despite this, her true<lf>demeanor is no secret to the villagers.<lf>Minoto holds her older sister, Hinoa, in<lf>very high regard, and frequently wishes<lf>that she were more like her.
<string>A man in the Gathering Hub who mentors<lf>young hunters and handles Arena quests.<lf>He taught you much of what you know<lf>about hunting. While his persistent<lf>dynamism is inspiring, it can lead him<lf>to easily get carried away at times. His<lf>talents also extend to mimicking monster<lf>roars and making monster masks.
<string>A Felyne who manages the Meowcenaries<lf>from the Buddy Plaza. Many years ago,<lf>he served as Elder Fugen's Palico. His<lf>skills haven't dulled since, and he can<lf>still best any young whippersnapper in<lf>the village. Calm and stoic, he exudes<lf>a perpetual air of dignity, and commands<lf>the respect of every villager, man and<lf>Felyne alike.
<string>A young man who works as the Buddy<lf>Plaza's Buddy Scout. He loves Felynes<lf>and Canynes, and enjoys spending his<lf>days among them. They feel the same<lf>about him. He is highly invested in<lf>raising Buddies, helping them realize<lf>their strengths, and maximizing their<lf>potential to become the best they can<lf>be. He is also Hamon's grandson.
<string>A woman who trades goods at the Buddy<lf>Plaza. She came to Kamura aboard a ship<lf>from a faraway land. Her elegant and<lf>refined behavior seems out of place<lf>for a typical merchant. Talking to her,<lf>it seems like she's hiding something...<lf>But she's quite taken with Kamura, and<lf>seems to be a stand-up gal nonetheless.
<string>Your beloved hometown, known for its<lf>roaring forges and skillful steelwork.<lf>The extremely high-quality steel and<lf>weaponry produced in Kamura have<lf>drawn in hunters from all around.<lf>Many tourists also visit to see its<lf>natural beauty. The village's remote<lf>location has given rise to a unique<lf>culture and rare hunting techniques.
<string>A large toad-shaped contraption sitting<lf>in the Kamura Training Area. It is<lf>equipped with many mechanisms to aid in<lf>hunters' weapon training. Another similar<lf>contraption exists in the Buddy Plaza to<lf>train aspiring Palicoes and Palamutes.<lf>Hamon made these using his ingenuity<lf>and past hunting experience.
