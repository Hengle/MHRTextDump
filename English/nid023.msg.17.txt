<string>What's up, <PL>?<lf>Gettin' enough rice in ya?
<string>Sorry, the shop isn't open right now.<lf>Come back later, would ya?
<string>Hey, <PL>, listen.<lf>Those dango at the Tea Shop<lf>are good, but rice is a staple.
<string>I mean, look at my wife. She's<lf>pretty as a picture thanks to all<lf>the rice she eats.
<string>Not that she'd be any less pretty<lf>without the rice—just saying, the<lf>rice helps her beauty stand out!
<string>...Wait a minute. What were<lf>we talking about again?<lf>Heck, oh well.
<string><PL>, hey now! Congrats to ya,<lf>becomin' a hunter and all!
<string>You won't find weapons, armor, or anything<lf>of the sort here, but those Bunny Dango<lf>for hunters are made from our rice.
<string>So, in a roundabout kinda way,<lf>my wife and I will still be helpin'<lf>you out there on your hunts!

<string>...Wait a minute.<lf>What were we talking about again?<lf>Heck, oh well.
<string>You know those Bunny Dango from<lf>the Tea Shop use a lot of our rice.
<string>Rice is an awesome source of energy.<lf>So make sure to eat some of those<lf>dango before a hunt, OK?

<string>Hey, <PL>, did you hear<lf>the Rampage is coming? Well, being<lf>a hunter, I figured you had.
<string>Being rice vendors, our job's making<lf>tons of food to take to the Stronghold,<lf>just in case the battle drags on.
<string>It'd be ideal if we could finish up<lf>at the Stronghold fast and without<lf>using up all the food, but...
<string>Guess we could sell any leftovers cheap.
<string>We prepared a fair amount of food, just<lf>in case the Rampage went on for a while.<lf>But we went through it in a flash.
<string>This village has too many gluttons! Ha!<lf>I thought Elder Fugen and Hinoa would<lf>eat the whole damn supply!
<string>You know, rice isn't our only popular<lf>product. Our soybean pastes and<lf>pickled veggies are pretty good too.
<string>Master Hamon is always buying 'em from us.<lf>Except, he's kinda particular about how he<lf>wants 'em made. He even gave us a recipe!
<string>But ever since we started using his recipe,<lf>they've been selling like crazy! Guess<lf>the man knows what he's talking about.
<string>So, it's you against Magnamalo, then.<lf>Make sure to eat up before heading out.
<string>"Empty bellies don't win battles."<lf>Strength, focus, drive, and grit:<lf>they only come if your stomach's full.
<string>The waters flowing through Kamura<lf>Village are amazingly pure. That's<lf>why we've got such tasty rice.
<string>When the village was decimated by<lf>the Rampage of fifty years ago, it took<lf>a long time for the waters to clear again.
<string>I don't have the strength to go through<lf>that again. We gotta end this thing<lf>before it reaches Kamura!
<string>Hey, <PL>,<lf>you eatin' properly these days?
<string>Eat plenty of rice, veggies, and meat, and with<lf>plenty of training, you'll be fit in both body AND<lf>mind! You'll get silky smooth skin too! Ha!
<string>I mean, look at my wife. She's always<lf>energetic and dazzlingly lovely! All<lf>from eating tons of tasty rice.
<string>How's Minoto doing?
<string>She's quite serious about eating right.<lf>She's always worried about Hinoa, so<lf>she comes in here to buy stuff from us.
<string>Hinoa's lucky to have such a nice<lf>sister. Well, I'm sure Hinoa herself<lf>knows that best, of course.

<string>I hear a massive horde is approaching.<lf>We're prepping food to carry into<lf>the Stronghold as we speak.
<string>We're bringing more in case it's a long<lf>haul, but I'm worried about Elder Fugen<lf>and Hinoa. Those two eat a LOT.
<string>So, <PL>,<lf>I gotta ask ya to end this one quick—<lf>before all of our food gets devoured.
<string>Hinoa looked like she was in pain<lf>when she bonded with that dragon<lf>thing. I couldn't bear to watch.
<string>She always used to clean her plate with<lf>a big smile on her face. Now she can<lf>barely even take a single bite...
<string>I didn't realize the loss of something<lf>so mundane could hit so hard.
<string>Well, at least she looks like<lf>she's better now, back to her<lf>hungry self and all.
<string>I never want to see her suffer like<lf>that again.
<string>The other day I got an order from<lf>the Hub, so I brought it over and<lf>I saw the craziest thing.
<string>Master Hojo, who's usually all smiles,<lf>was in a meeting with the Guild,<lf>looking all scary like.
<string>He sounded so serious too, completely<lf>different from the Hojo I'm used to.
<string>I guess that's him working hard to<lf>protect this village from the Rampage<lf>and that dragon.
<string>Hey. Heard that dragon has a full name now.<lf>Wind Serpent Ibushi, was it?
<string>My wife and I will do our part<lf>to prepare as much food as we<lf>can for the upcoming battle.
<string>But the fighting, we gotta leave it to you.<lf>So, eat up, and get yourself ready.
<string>Time to hunt Ibushi.<lf>You ready, <PL>?
<string>Leave the Stronghold to us. Well, "us"<lf>as in my wife and I prepping the food<lf>while the defenders do the defending.
<string>Still, we've got tons of food ready,<lf>so we should be fine...even with Elder<lf>Fugen and Hinoa...I hope.
<string>You did great, <PL>.<lf>I guess there's still work to be done,<lf>but it'll progress thanks to you.
<string>By the way, the food we brought to<lf>the Stronghold... Elder Fugen and<lf>Hinoa managed to wolf it all down.
<string>But hey, we're still able to laugh at<lf>the simple things like that. Kamura's<lf>amazing, in more ways than one.
<string>When I heard Minoto resonated with<lf>a dragon too, I ran to the Hub in<lf>a flash...
<string>But she looked normal. Well, better than<lf>normal. She even grinned and said, "I'm<lf>resonating, just like Hinoa!"
<string>Then she started humming, and her eyes<lf>were glowing gold... Well, as long as she's<lf>happy, I guess.
<string>Hey, <PL>.<lf>We were just brainstorming a<lf>collaboration with the Tea Shop.
<string>We're thinking how we should celebrate<lf>your victorious return! So, naturally, we've<lf>got to make sure we do it justice.
<string>You can count on there being good<lf>drinks in it, too. Sounds good, huh?
<string>It'll be the party for the ages.<lf>Good luck out there!
<string>And here I thought the Raths were the<lf>most annoying couple. Ibushi and Narwa<lf>can't catch a hint can they!?
<string>Well, if they want to stick around<lf>and fight, Kamura's got something<lf>for 'em!
<string>From what I hear, elder dragons<lf>and other monsters started crawling<lf>out of the woodwork left and right.
<string>Things are gonna get hectic,<lf>so make sure to eat up, OK?
<string>Rice...? Got it. Drinks...? Got it...<lf>Oh, hey, <PL>. How're your<lf>preparations going?
<string>Us, we're getting ready for the party.<lf>Gotta celebrate the end of the Rampage,<lf>you know?
<string>Make sure to come back with an empty<lf>stomach. We'll have a ton of good food<lf>and drinks ready for ya.
<string>The docks are getting busier again,<lf>with the news that the Rampage's<lf>ending.
<string>There might even be a bunch of<lf>new ingredients coming in that we<lf>can add to our store's repertoire!
<string>And it's all thanks to you,<lf><PL>. Thank you.
<string>I've known my wife, Suzukari, since we<lf>were kids. Even then she was a darling;<lf>it was love at first sight for me.
<string>One day, I manned up and said, "Will you<lf>stay at my shop and cook rice with me!?"<lf>...And that's how we ended up married.
<string>I'm the happiest man in Kamura,<lf>marrying such a lovely gal.

<string>The rice balls Seihaku sells are<lf>handmade in our shop, by us.
<string>Seihaku loves rice, and when he said<lf>he wanted to work with it, we agreed.
<string>But when he gets to staring at Komitsu,<lf>he forgets all about his shop duties.<lf>But you can't blame him. Hahaha!

<string>Hey, <PL>!<lf>Eatin' enough rice?
<string>I know you hunters are always busy running<lf>around. But don't forget rice has everything<lf>you need to keep you goin'!
<string>My wife's always full of energy and<lf>glowing with beauty—and that's<lf>all down to eating tons of rice.
<string>Strong, spirited, and beautiful! If you<lf>wanna be a famous hunter, you'll need<lf>those three qualities, just like her!
<string>Seems you're still getting a lot of quests,<lf>with or without the Rampage. Busy times<lf>for a hunter, huh?
<string>Make sure you're not skipping meals.
<string>Hunting without eating can trip<lf>you up when you least expect it.<lf>Food's important no matter what.
