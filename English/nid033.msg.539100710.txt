<string>It is I, Fukashigi the Informant,<lf>at your service!
<string>I covered my tracks so carefully, and<lf>yet you found me anyway. You really<lf>are a fur-st rate Kamura hunter.
<string>I can't divulge my true identity, but<lf>I'm a connoisseur of secrets, let's say.
<string>I often get my paws on mew infur-mation<lf>that's sure to pique your interest.
<string>I look forward to working with you.
<string>It is I, Fukashigi the Informant,<lf>at your service!
<string>Looks like you still haven't done enough<lf>fur me to paw over this intel.
<string>I'll update you once you've completed<lf>an urgent quest fur Hinoa.
<string>It is I, Fukashigi the Informant,<lf>at your service!
<string>Very well. I'll impawrt to you<lf>the fur-st dirty secret of Kamura...
<string>Hinoa the Quest Maiden...
<string>Is really...
<string>Into spicy food!
<string>Well, it could be sweet or spicy—<lf>she'll eat just about anything...
<string>By my whiskers, wasn't that juicy?<lf>I'll update you again once you've<lf>completed an urgent quest from Hinoa.
<string>It is I, Fukashigi the Informant,<lf>at your service!
<string>Very well. I'll impawrt to you the<lf>second dirty secret of Kamura...
<string>Fugen the Elder...
<string>Is really...
<string>A big Cohoot-lover!
<string>He even keeps three of them: Ichiho,<lf>Brother in Arms; Nim, Teller of Tales;<lf>and, Scouting Chief Sanra!
<string>Ichiho fought alongside Elder Fugen<lf>when he was still a hunter. Now,<lf>it's gone into retirement with Fugen.
<string>Elder Fugen treats all his Cohoots like<lf>members of his family! How SO very<lf>heartwarming. It makes me want to purr!
<string>By my whiskers, wasn't that juicy?<lf>I'll update you again once you've<lf>completed an urgent quest from Hinoa.
<string>It is I, Fukashigi the Informant,<lf>at your service!
<string>Very well. I'll impawrt to you<lf>the third dirty secret of Kamura...
<string>That meowsterious beast Guild Master<lf>Hojo sits upon...
<string>Is really...
<string>A baby Tetsucabra—<lf>hence its name, "Tetsy"!
<string>Its favorite food appears to be Bunny<lf>Dango, but every once-in-a-while,<lf>it snacks on fish fur-om the river.
<string>By my whiskers, wasn't that juicy?<lf>I'll update you again once you've<lf>completed an urgent quest from Hinoa.
<string>It is I, Fukashigi the Informant,<lf>at your service!
<string>Very well. I'll impawrt to you<lf>the fourth dirty secret of Kamura...
<string>Kagero the Merchant...
<string>Was, in the past...
<string>A purr-etty stellar hunter!
<string>Kagero's origins are shrouded in meowstery,<lf>as is his heroic past as a hunter long ago.
<string>By my whiskers, wasn't that juicy?<lf>I'll update you again once you've<lf>completed an urgent quest from Hinoa.
<string>It is I, Fukashigi the Informant,<lf>at your service!
<string>Very well. I'll impawrt to you<lf>the fifth dirty secret of Kamura...
<string>Minoto the Hub Maiden's...
<string>Drawing skills... Hmm. Well, uh...<lf>To be blunt, they SUCK!
<string>One day, I snuck into the Gathering Hub<lf>and saw Minoto sketching...
<string>She giggled and said she was trying to draw<lf>Master Hojo. But it didn't look like Hojo<lf>at all! It looked exactly like a Tetranadon!
<string>*sigh* Some people have artistic sense<lf>but I don't think Minoto is one of them...
<string>By my whiskers, wasn't that juicy?<lf>I'll update you again once you've<lf>completed an urgent quest from Hinoa.
<string>It is I, Fukashigi the Informant,<lf>at your service!
<string>Very well. I'll impawrt to you<lf>the sixth dirty secret of Kamura...
<string>Buddy Handler Iori...
<string>Is really...
<string>A purr-etty good singer!
<string>But he won't sing for anyone! Everyone<lf>in the Buddy Plaza is always trying to<lf>get him to sing, but he's too shy.
<string>By my whiskers, wasn't that juicy?<lf>I'll update you again once you've<lf>completed an urgent quest from Hinoa.
<string>Next up is a big one, a two-pawrter<lf>of sorts. I hope you're ready!
<string>It is I, Fukashigi the Informant,<lf>at your service!
<string>Very well. I'll impawrt to you one half<lf>of the most special secret of Kamura...
<string>The reason that Rice Ball Artist Seihaku<lf>likes Komitsu the Sweettooth...
<string>Is really...
<string>Because of you, <PL>!
<string>Shocked, are you? That's right—<lf>YOU! It was you who led that rice<lf>enthusiast down the path of love!
<string>It all started way back, when<lf>you began devoting yourself day<lf>and night to your hunter training.
<string>Seihaku's mom asked him to deliver<lf>some rice balls to you at the Training<lf>Area...
<string>And Komitsu tagged along because she<lf>wanted to give you a candy apple too.
<string>But they took a wrong turn, and<lf>ended up lost in the Shrine Ruins,<lf>when suddenly, meownsters appeared!
<string>Seihaku hid, trembling and on the<lf>verge of tears. Komitsu held him<lf>through it all, comfur-ting him...
<string>Even though Komitsu was fur-rightened<lf>too, she kept smiling and telling him<lf>that everything was going to be OK.
<string>Oh me, oh my, what a good kid!<lf>Ever since, Seihaku has been smitten<lf>with Komitsu and her courageous spirit.
<string>But, afraid that she now sees him<lf>as weak, he is too shy to be straight<lf>with her...
<string>And he feared you would feel responsible<lf>if you ever knew, so he kept it a secret.<lf>It isn't your fault, after all.
<string>By my whiskers, that was juicy.<lf>Thus concludes one part of my<lf>most special, secret intel.
<string>It is I, Fukashigi the Informant,<lf>at your service!
<string>Very well. I'll impawrt to you one half<lf>of the most special secret of Kamura...
<string>Yomogi the Chef...
<string>Really...
<string>Has no idea of the secret truth<lf>of her origin.
<string>In fact, most of the villagers have<lf>no idea about it either, so treat<lf>this knowledge with care...
<string>When Yomogi was but a babe, she was<lf>brought to Kamura by a Wyverian hunter<lf>for safekeeping.
<string>After that, the Wyverian was never<lf>heard from again, so the village<lf>ended up taking Yomogi in.
<string>The only people who know who she is or<lf>where she came from are Elder Fugen,<lf>Master Hojo, Hinoa, and Minoto.
<string>I can feel it, though...
<string>An air of "exaltation" emew-nates<lf>from Yomogi—a sort of purr-estige<lf>or nobility well outside the norm.
<string>Purr-haps she was born into<lf>a distant aristocracy, or more...
<string>But well, now I'm just speculating.
<string>By my whiskers, that was juicy.<lf>Thus concludes one part of my<lf>most special, secret intel.
