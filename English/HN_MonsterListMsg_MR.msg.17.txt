<string>Daimyo Hermitaurs' weak point is their head. Attacking<lf>it will inflict massive damage, so focus your attention<lf>there. However, they will use their gargantuan claws to<lf>defend themselves and to protect this soft spot. Using<lf>a <COL RED>Sonic Bomb</COL> when they adopt a defensive position is<lf>an excellent tactic to "crack the shell to get the nut inside."
<string>Large Carapaceons that live in coastal regions and<lf>sandy soil. Daimyo Hermitaurs use their massive<lf>claws to guard themselves against enemy attacks.<lf>These creatures wear wyvern skulls on their backs,<lf>unlike the shells carried in their infancy. These<lf>shells serve not only as protection, but also as a<lf>method for attacking prey. They are highly valued for<lf>their materials—their brains in particular.
<string>Shogun Ceanataur change up the way they fight<lf>depending on the shell they wear. Breaking the<lf>shell exposes the weak point, so focus your<lf>attention there. However, Shogun Ceanataur wield<lf>claws that can attack a wide area. Prioritize<lf>breaking the claws to reduce their threat.
<string>These large Carapaceons can be found around<lf>volcanoes and in the Flooded Forest. Shogun<lf>Ceanataur wield long, developed claws that are<lf>usually folded away, but unfurl into terrifying<lf>blades when enraged. Shogun Ceanataur, like<lf>the Daimyo Hermitaur, are also known to use<lf>wyvern skulls as shells. Specimens that do,<lf>have been observed using a water jet-like attack.
<string>Since Furious Rajang lack a tail, you'll need to focus<lf>your attention on attacking their head to knock them<lf>out of rampage mode. Keep in mind that Furious<lf>Rajang use a lot of powerful restraining attacks, so<lf>if you get clobbered, use Wirefall to quickly recover<lf>and retreat.
<string>Furious Rajang are Rajang variants that are covered in<lf>golden fur. Normally Rajang return to their black-furred<lf>state after being agitated for a time to conserve energy,<lf>but these beasts have lost the ability to curb their anger.<lf>Outclassing the standard Rajang's attack power, they<lf>assault with seething rage. At the apex of their fury<lf>they become enraged and turn into destructive demons<lf>with electrified manes.

<string>Coming into contact with patches of scales may<lf>infect you with the Frenzy virus. You'll lose your<lf>natural ability to heal and become more susceptible<lf>to all forms of attack. Keep attacking before<lf>infection sets in to overcome it. Its Frenzied State<lf>can be dispelled by attacking the head.
<string>Gore Magala possess wings with black, shroud-like<lf>membrane. They lack visual receptors, heightening<lf>their senses by scattering scales from their wings<lf>to ascertain the locations of lifeforms. At the peak<lf>of their senses, feelers extend from their head,<lf>their wings unfurl, and they become frenzied. They're<lf>feared not only for their sinister appearance<lf>but also for the mysterious Frenzy virus they carry.
<string>Shagaru Magala use a variety of attacks—including area<lf>breath attacks and explosive pollen—and wield their black<lf>scales to even deadlier effect than Gore Magala. The Frenzy<lf>is as much of a threat as ever, so don't forget to bring<lf><COL RED>Nulberries</COL>. Keep your eyes and ears peeled for powerful<lf>wingarm strikes and their bevy of breath attacks.
<string>The form taken by Gore Magala once they mature and<lf>molt. Gorgeous, glittering scales cover Shagaru Magala,<lf>and their divine wings are large enough to wrap around<lf>their entire body. According to records, one was once<lf>said to have scattered its black scales over an area the<lf>size of a mountain, annihilating any and all lifeforms<lf>inhabiting that region.
<string>When battling Seregios, watch out for flanking<lf>aerial movements, and vicious hind leg attacks. The<lf>razor-like scales they launch from all over their<lf>body can inflict Bleeding if too many connect,<lf>increasing future damage as you attack or evade.<lf>Make sure you go in knowing how to deal with this status.
<string>Large Flying Wyverns with sharp, blade-like scales<lf>covering their body. Seregios are well-known as<lf>extremely territorial and belligerent creatures,<lf>wielding their aerial mobility and powerful hind leg<lf>attacks in intense combat against other large<lf>monsters. Reports have confirmed that Seregios<lf>have the ability to launch the scales from their body,<lf>inflicting their victims with the Bleeding status.
<string>Attacks with their head, wings, or tail will be<lf>charged with electricity. The movement, attack<lf>range, and strength of each part changes when<lf>electrified; when all parts are charged, these<lf>creatures become particularly dangerous, so targeting<lf>electrified parts to dispel their charge is essential.
<string>Large Flying Wyverns with crest-shaped organs that<lf>let them control vast amounts of electricity. Astalos<lf>vibrate these organs on their head, forked tail, and<lf>brilliant wings to charge the respective body part<lf>with electricity, yielding tremendous strength and<lf>an amplified attack range. Violent to a fault,<lf>witnesses have observed them using all their might<lf>to drive intruders from their territory.

<string>When these variants concentrate their Hellfire, they<lf>can unleash powerful attacks but also become more<lf>susceptible to damage if the Hellfire on their body is<lf>detonated. Press the attack further to send them into<lf>the Raging Hellfire state. But beware of powerful<lf>attacks from body parts infused with Hellfire!
<string>A Magnamalo variant that achieves an even more<lf>twisted, malevolent form. Filled with hatred, they<lf>are known as "Scorned Magnamalo." Shrouded<lf>in Hellfire at all times, they also boast larger arm<lf>blades and harder armor plating. During battles,<lf>they have been spotted focusing their Hellfire<lf>and swinging it like a blade.
<string>Ignites pinecones in a variety of ways, then attacks<lf>using a variety of arcs. The cones will explode when<lf>touched, or after a certain amount of time. When<lf>enraged these Bishaten subspecies have a fiery<lf>breath attack. Positioning is key as any cones<lf>in this breath attack's path will be ignited.
<string>A subspecies named for their auburn fur. Inquisitive<lf>by nature, Blood Orange Bishaten can even appear<lf>near human habitats. Their belly pouch is stuffed with<lf>combustible pinecones, and this subspecies has<lf>a distinct and focused fire breath. The breath itself<lf>isn't as dangerous as the pinecones it ignites. Reports<lf>indicate that it's possible to topple these monsters<lf>while they balance on their tails.
<string>This subspecies slides and circles around more often<lf>than the normal Somnacanth. Keep focused on their<lf>position when they have all four legs on the ground.<lf>The ice breath is very powerful, causing near-fatal<lf>freezing. You can escape up in the air, but focus<lf>on circling behind and keeping your distance.
<string>Light illuminates the dust scattered around this<lf>subspecies, making their fantastical appearance<lf>shimmer softly. Aurora Somnacanth sprays icy blasts<lf>in place of sleeping powder, attacking all who dare<lf>enter their territory. They use the permanent cold<lf>emanating from their bodies to freeze the vicinity,<lf>and then the frozen surface to move around swiftly.
<string>Pyre Rakna-Kadaki coordinate with the Pyrantula they<lf>scatter around. Ignoring these small fry will strengthen<lf>their explosive attacks, so slay any nearby Pyrantula.<lf>Attacking the abdomen reduces the number of Pyrantula<lf>they can spread around. Continued attacks cause them<lf>to lay eggs and stop coordinating with the tiny Temnocerans.
<string>A subspecies of Rakna-Kadaki filled with explosive<lf>material, their bodies are covered in a dark red, explosion-<lf>resistant webbing. An advanced chain of command lets<lf>them direct their offspring with a special sound-producing<lf>organ. On offense, they strike their forelimbs like flints to<lf>induce explosions. Connecting special detonation threads<lf>to offspring in the area lets them expand the explosive area<lf>to their positions.
<string>Characterized by raging attacks using the magma<lf>rock on their tail. A larger rock means more powerful<lf>attacks. Attacking the tail can cause the rock to<lf>explode, causing damage. Enters a heated, softer<lf>state when preparing a rock or after moving around<lf>underground, marking the perfect time to attack.
<string>Unlike normal Almudron, Magma Almudron<lf>live in the Lava Caverns, and can manipulate<lf>magma instead of mud. They secrete a special<lf>liquid that melts the ground, allowing them to<lf>move freely through the earth. Known for their<lf>aggressive nature, they become extremely<lf>agitated when trespassers set foot on their<lf>turf, attacking them unrelentingly.

<string>Certain attacks will cause Bloodblight, causing your<lf>life to continuously drain but your attacks to also<lf>heal you; keep the pressure on. The Bloodening will<lf>occur after a certain amount of time, leading to<lf>raging attacks; end it and get a knock down by<lf>hitting the red flashing areas on the arms and neck.
<string>A dragon covered with elegant silver scales. It uses<lf>the Qurio to drain the life energy of other living<lf>creatures, creeping around at night and attacking<lf>its prey from behind. It appears almost regal to<lf>start with, but after draining enough energy, it<lf>can turn a violent, fresh-blood crimson. This form<lf>is known as the "Bloodening" and is widely feared.
<string>Lunagaron have different attacks depending on their stance. They<lf>also use ice attacks, so raising your ice resistance should give you<lf>an edge. Lunagaron are extremely agile when on all fours, so try not<lf>to lose track of them. When covered in ice, a continuous assault will<lf>not only result in shattering the covering but will also topple the beast.<lf>Mind your positioning when powerful attacks are incoming.
<string>Lunagaron have an organ that chills the air they<lf>inhale, circulating it throughout their body in a<lf>unique form of thermoregulation. They can travel<lf>long distances and endure environmental changes,<lf>allowing them to occupy a wide range of habitats.<lf>They usually walk on all fours, but can stand on<lf>two legs by shutting down their cooling mechanism,<lf>spiking their body temp to expand their muscles.
<string>Garangolm will reinforce their arms by covering them in<lf>elements. When their arms are in this state, continuously<lf>attacking the elemental covering will eventually break it off,<lf>toppling the beast. Focus your assault on their arms as soon<lf>as they're covered!
<string>A monster characterized by its massive and rigid body.<lf>Garangolm are generally placid, living in regions with<lf>fertile soil. Their sap-like fluids can promote plant<lf>growth, forging a symbiotic relationship with flora<lf>that grows in their bodies. They can also use that<lf>sap to harden plants or the surrounding soil, outfitting<lf>their bodies and enhancing their attacks.
<string>Gaismagorm attacks with the explosive, crystallized Qurio<lf>on its carapace. Break these crystals by attacking, but <lf>beware: Gaismagorm can consume the shards and <lf>use them to deliver even more explosive attacks. When<lf>Gaismagorm climbs the pit's wall, it's readying a strong <lf>attack. Use the ballistae provided to stop it.
<string>A gargantuan monster living in the darkest depths since<lf>ancient times. Gaismagorm's rock-like forearms boast<lf>tenacious strength which allows it to burrow underground.<lf>It has a symbiotic relationship with the Qurio, and feeds<lf>on their life force for energy. Once it has chosen a place<lf>to nest, it collapses the surrounding rock bed to create<lf>an opening to the surface. The opening forms a massive<lf>crater in which it releases the Qurio through.
<string>Their breath attacks are particularly annoying, inflicting<lf>poison, paralysis, and fireblight. Make sure you have<lf>resistance skills and ailment recovery items at the ready<lf>before the hunt. Espinas run riot with charge attacks<lf>when enraged, but the increased blood flow softens<lf>their flesh, so lay on the pain when you get the chance!
<string>Flying Wyverns known for the red spikes on their<lf>tough green frame, forming both a means of attack<lf>and defense, thus generally keeping foes at bay.<lf>As a result, they are often seen sprawled out and<lf>relaxing in their domain. Once they sense danger,<lf>however, they expand their blood vessels to turn<lf>their hide and wing membranes a bright red,<lf>and they will run riot with noteworthy brutality.

<string>Small Neopterons found primarily on land, featuring<lf>two developed horns and legs peppered with sharp<lf>thorns. Extremely territorial, Hornetaurs attack any<lf>who approach without mercy. When processed, the<lf>shells around their bodies boast impressive strength;<lf>in their current state, however, too much "umph"<lf>when attacking can easily obliterate them, rendering<lf>them useless. Collect those materials with care!
<string>Neopterons with paralyzing poison stingers<lf>on their abdomen. Vespoids adapt to almost<lf>any environment, and have been observed in<lf>many regions. Their sharp stingers are powerful<lf>enough to let them relentlessly jab any outsiders<lf>with a paralytic agent. They are delicate, weak<lf>to impacts, and make great materials for toxic<lf>weaponry.
<string>Small Bird Wyverns inhabiting the Jungle. Velociprey<lf>are well-known for their yellow beaks, accenting bodies<lf>of black and blue stripes. They form packs, often engaging<lf>in communal behavior. These slender creatures can and<lf>will attack with sharp movements and sharper claws, so<lf>best be on your guard to avoid the pointy ends.
<string>The juvenile form of Daimyo Hermitaur, these small<lf>Carapaceons live around coastal areas and sandy soil.<lf>They often hide in sand, popping out of their hidey-<lf>holes only to claw at nearby intruders. The sizable<lf>shells they carry protect their vitals; as they grow in<lf>size, they'll move to larger dwellings to accommodate,<lf>such as monster skulls. The Carapaceon Brains they<lf>yield are quite the delicacy.
<string>The juvenile form of Shogun Ceanataur, these<lf>small Carapaceons live around volcanoes and<lf>in the Flooded Forest. Like Hermitaurs, Ceanataurs<lf>usually hide underground, surfacing to attack<lf>intruders with a discharge of toxic fluids. Their<lf>quick little legs make these critters a real pain<lf>in a hunter's coil. Carapaceon Brains from<lf>Ceanataurs are also in high demand.
<string>Offspring of the Pyre Rakna-Kadaki. Pyrantula<lf>usually stay put, relying on their progenitor for<lf>almost all movement. On the other hand, they<lf>treat all who approach as threats, eagerly attacking<lf>any invaders they detect. Their bodies contain<lf>explosive gasses that the Pyre Rakna-Kadaki<lf>can detonate through webs, generating small<lf>explosions.
<string>Herbivorous monsters with fluffy tails. Their tails<lf>are mostly composed of slate gray hair; some<lf>scholars surmise that this trait lets them roll into<lf>balls to disguise themselves as rocks. Others<lf>believe their tails serve to hide and protect<lf>newborn offspring. Gentle by nature, they tend<lf>to live in herds. They are easily frightened, and<lf>the entire group will flee when attacked.
<string>Bird Wyverns living in the highlands of the Citadel.<lf>These calculating creatures hunt their prey with<lf>cunning, often waiting for them to grow weak before<lf>striking. They're dangerous creatures that surround<lf>their prey in packs with their sizeable claws ready<lf>to strike, so don't approach them carelessly.
<string>Larger than regular Ludroth, Royal Ludroth use<lf>their sponge-like mane to absorb water and keep<lf>from drying out on land. Once the sponge loses<lf>moisture, they will seek out water to recover.<lf>They also spew mucus to trip up their prey.
