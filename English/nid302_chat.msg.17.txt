<string>The Rampage is here!<lf>Y-You're ready, right!?
<string>They're all gone! Oh jeez, I<lf>was freaking out there...
<string>I can't believe this was all<lf>for nothing... F-Fall back!
<string>OK, that's good enough!<lf>Let's head back to the village!
<string>Stronghold's wrecked... But hey,<lf>at least we made some progress.
<string>Hey! Mission complete!<lf>Never doubted you for a minute!
<string>All the missions are done AND DONE!<lf>Great work!
<string>There's a new mission for you!<lf>Don't get hurt out there!
<string>The horde's coming!<lf>They won't get past me!
<string>The next wave is close! We<lf>don't have long to prepare!
<string>This is the big finale!<lf>Just a little bit longer...!
<string>They're attacking one of the gates!<lf>We have to defend it!
<string>Looks like our defenses are<lf>down but we can't give up yet!
<string>The monsters are invading!?<lf>They got here so quick...!
<string>The last gate's under attack!<lf>If it falls, we're done for!
<string>The last gate can't take<lf>much more! Ugh, this is bad!
<string>That's one of those Gate Breakers!<lf>We have to stop it!
<string>Stalkers target hunters!<lf>Stay sharp!
<string>Look out! Targeters can attack<lf>you from long range!
<string>It's Ibushi!<lf>It's coming this way now!
<string>We've got monsters on<lf>the attack! Look out!
<string>Something awful is coming...<lf>Why now, of all times!?
<string>Alright, I'm all powered up!<lf>Weapons, ready...and, attack!
<string>This is the turning point!<lf>We can do this...FOR KAMURA!
<string>An installation is down...<lf>Hang on, it'll be fixed soon!
<string>An Apex! If we get rid of it,<lf>the horde should scatter!
<string>Looks like the Apex is readying<lf>a huge attack! Watch out!
<string>That attack... Yikes.
<string>I think that roar just made<lf>the horde a whole lot angrier!
<string>The Apex is destroying the<lf>Stronghold! You have to hurry!
<string>Wh-What happened!? Are you OK?<lf>Don't push yourself too much!
<string>Woah, that installation did<lf>some serious damage!
<string>Hey...was, uh, that thing<lf>even turned on?
<string>Great work! But us villagers<lf>aren't about to be outdone!
<string>You gotta be kidding me!<lf>Wow, you're unstoppable!
<string>That's the <PL> I know!<lf>You can't be beaten!
<string>You're gonna end the calamity!<lf>You're a hero—Kamura's hope!
<string>I'm gonna go all-out,<lf>just like you, <PL>!
<string>I won't let a single monster<lf>past the Stronghold!
