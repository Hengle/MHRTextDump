<string>You can execute a dash with <ICON ANALOG_LS>+<OPT PLDASH>.<lf>Dashing consumes stamina but <COL RED>allows you<lf>to run much quicker</COL>. You cannot dash when<lf>your stamina has dropped below a certain<lf>level.
<string>You can dodge attacks <COL RED>at the cost of some<lf>stamina</COL>. When battling a large monster,<lf>evading while dashing away from it will<lf>perform a more effective dodge called an<lf><COL RED>Emergency Evasion</COL>.
<string>If you <COL RED>dash down a slope</COL>, you will perform<lf>a sliding maneuver. This lets you quickly<lf>cover ground without using up stamina, but<lf>at the cost of being unable to evade attacks.
<string>When knocked down by a monster, you can<lf>briefly <COL RED>negate</COL> damage from follow-up<lf>attacks by not pressing any buttons and<lf>staying down. However, be wary—some foes<lf>can still hurt an incapacitated hunter.

<string>Dodging or Emergency Evading just as<lf>you are about to be hit will stun your foe<lf>and also fill your Wyvern Riding Gauge.

<string>Can be used once your Wyvern Riding<lf>gauge is full. <COL RED>This will deal a huge blow<lf>to a monster</COL>, so make sure not to miss.<lf><lf>You only have a limited time to use it<lf>though, and if you miss the attack<lf>window, you will automatically dismount.
<string>Performing Wirebug actions consumes<lf>the <COL RED>Wirebug Gauge</COL>, which recovers over<lf>time. Once recovered, the gauge can be<lf>used again. The <COL RED>degree of consumption</COL><lf>and <COL RED>recovery time</COL> vary for each action.
<string>Perform airborne acrobatics with Wirebugs<lf>to move toward a destination or target.<lf>Chain these moves together, or lead into<lf>a jump attack with <ICON PAD_X>. This will execute<lf>a <COL RED>wall run</COL> if used while facing a wall.

<string>Press <OPT ZL>+<ICON PAD_B> when a monster<lf>sends you flying to execute a Wirefall<lf>(this consumes some of your Wirebug<lf>Gauge), allowing you to quickly recover<lf>and evade any oncoming attacks.
<string>Hold <OPT ZL> (Blademasters) or <OPT Gunner_RT> (Gunners)<lf>with your weapon drawn, then press either<lf><ICON PAD_X> or <ICON PAD_A> to perform a unique Silkbind<lf>attack. Refer to Weapon Controls in your<lf>Hunter's Notes for more details.
<string>Move towards an ivy wall and you<lf>will automatically grab on to it.
<string><COL RED>Perform a Wiredash while facing a wall</COL><lf>to initiate a wall run.
