<string>Hey, <PL>! Word on the waters<lf>is you're heading to the Kingdom's outpost?<lf>That's amazing!
<string>Hey, take a good-luck charm or two!<lf>Pops sent me a bunch. Dunno why<lf>they're all squishy, though. Weird...
<string>What's inside? I...uh...don't know...<lf>Who goes around tearing open good-luck<lf>charms and spilling out their guts?
<string>Besides, this is Pops we're talking<lf>about. Probably best not to look.<lf>Who knows where he got 'em from.
<string>...On second thought, I better check.<lf>If anything happened while you had<lf>one of these, I'd never forgive myself.
<string>Well, if it isn't <PL>.<lf>Welcome back! How's the hunts<lf>over in the Kingdom treating you?
<string>You eatin' right over there? I'm sure<lf>Wakana's asked you if you're eating<lf>enough veggies. Speaking of...
<string>You gotta help me out. She keeps<lf>giving me vegetables and there's<lf>no way I can eat them all.
<string>Please tell me you'll take some.<lf>Please! I'm begging you here!
<string>I told my Pops about you working over<lf>in the Kingdom.
<string>Says he'll come visit you and bring you<lf>something special. But I don't know<lf>if I would take what he's bringing...
<string>He just got this shipment of pelts, but<lf>they're super thick and bristly. He gave<lf>them to Master Hamon, but...
<string>Hamon said they were impossible to work<lf>with. Said he'd need some kind of special<lf>needle.
<string>And even then, they'd never work as gear.<lf>I guess you could make a rug out them, but<lf>I wouldn't put my tootsies on them things!
<string>Pops sent me a delivery of fish I'd never<lf>seen before the other day. I took one to<lf>Kajika to see if he knew what it was.
<string>Said he also never seen it before, but<lf>was eager to "try it meow-t." And before<lf>I knew it, he had gobbled it down.
<string>I was gonna tell him to wait until I knew it<lf>was safe to eat, but Pops would never send<lf>poisonous fish, right? I'm sure it's fine.
<string>Still, Kajika seemed... I dunno, younger?<lf>Rejuvenated, even. Must be my imagination.
<string>Oh, great timing, <PL>!<lf>I just got a shipment of meat from Pops!<lf>Mihaba and I are gonna have a party.
<string>Wanna come? Don't worry! Pops<lf>actually sent us some good quality<lf>meat this time. It'll be good!
<string>Wish I could say the same about the<lf>sauce though... It has a strange aroma<lf>and glows a dull blue. Kinda slimy, too...
<string>Uh, not that we have to use it! I'll ask<lf>Otemai to hook us up with some sauce<lf>and seasoning! It'll be fine!
<string>Welcome back, <PL>! Word<lf>on the waters is you're making waves<lf>over in the Kingdom. Happy to hear it!
<string>As for me, things have really picked<lf>up. Lots more cargo coming into<lf>the dock these days.
<string>Ever since you went off to the Outpost,<lf>royal trade ships are bringing in more<lf>and more goods.
<string>It's like you're a bridge to the Kingdom.<lf>A go-between? A matchmaker, even?<lf>Ha! OK, maybe that's going too far!
<string>Either way, everyone in the village is<lf>excited about all the new and rare items<lf>coming in. And it's all thanks to you!
