<string>...Shall we cast off?
<string>I'm counting on you.
<string>...Steady as she goes.
<string>Let us begin.
<string>Right. Let's hunt ourselves<lf>a Rathalos and a Tigrex.
<string>Your assistance is appreciated.
<string>The target is a Bazelgeuse.<lf>Let's head on out.
<string>Your assistance is appreciated.
<string>The target is a Chameleos.<lf>I hope you are ready.
<string>Your assistance is appreciated.
<string>The target is a Furious Rajang.<lf>Be ready for anything.
<string>Maybe you just talk too much.
<string>Well, don't let me stop you.
<string><PL> has really<lf>been a big help for us.
<string>We're grateful you sent such<lf>a talented hunter to Elgado.
<string>Very well. As a knight of the<lf>Royal Order, I shall give it my all.
<string>But I'll be counting on your<lf>assistance, Fiorayne.
<string>...Yes, it has been some time,<lf>hasn't it?
<string>...This is an excellent opportunity<lf>to show me what you're made of!
<string>*sigh*
<string>Focus on the mission.
<string>...No more older than you,<lf>Old Timer.
<string>...Enjoying yourself much, Arlow?
<string>I've never seen you put so much<lf>enthusiasm into a hunt.
<string>...Hmph.<lf>We'll see who the "ol' man" is!
<string>You feeling alright, Jae?<lf>You don't look so well...
<string>There is no being alive who<lf>can eat that much.
<string>...No. <PL> and I have<lf>gone hunting several times.
<string>I'll have to work hard to earn<lf>your respect.
<string>Let's see what the power of Elgado<lf>and Kamura can do!
<string>Not at all! In fact, the Outpost's morale<lf>has greatly improved and spirits are high!
<string>Once things have settled down,<lf>we'd very much like to visit Kamura!
<string>...Ha! And you too, good Elder!<lf>Show me what you're made of!
