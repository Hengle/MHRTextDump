<string>Hey there, <PL>!<lf>Word is you're heading for the Kingdom's<lf>meowtpost?
<string>To think you'd head for the outside<lf>world, <PL>...<lf>Best not go half-baked!
<string>And don't worry about Kamura—between<lf>Elder Fugen, Utsushi, Hinoa and Minoto,<lf>we have more than enough cooks here.
<string>So you go and see what the outside has<lf>in store for you with a clear conscience—<lf>and a clean palate!
<string>Since you went to Elgado, <PL>,<lf>Utsushi goes on fur-ever about your<lf>adventures.
<string>Simmer down, I says. Why not go see fur<lf>yourself, I says? And what's he do? He<lf>says, "you're right!" and runs off!
<string>So then did he, you know...go all the<lf>way to see you?
<string>You poor thing. I don't see how your<lf>pot can get boiling with a master<lf>like that always watching you...
<string>By the way, <PL>,<lf>how's the Tea Shop in Elgado doing?<lf>Not a bad spot, if'n I do say so myself!
<string>That shop's just one branch we set up<lf>to expand dango outside of Kamura. It's<lf>been there since way be-fur the Rampage.
<string>And Azuki is a fine purr-prietor!<lf>She runs the place with a natural<lf>knack for hos-purr-tality.
<string>Trade outside of Kamura ain't no joke.<lf>It all boils down to understanding and<lf>respecting the customs and food culture.
<string>The success of Elgado's Tea Shop is<lf>the fruit of her labors. Stop by and say<lf>hi when you can, <PL>.
<string>When we were thinkin' of opening a Tea<lf>Shop furr-anchise, we were in a pickle about<lf>tweaking the formula for outside tastes.
<string>But then Yomogi said, "If it ain't broke,<lf>don't fix it! That fur-lavor everyone<lf>savors makes them the hit they are.
<string>Once we get some tails in the seats,<lf>we can test the local waters, and then<lf>adjust accordingly."
<string>It's enough to make a grown Felyne cry.<lf>My little sprout's all grown up! Couldn't<lf>be happier to see it.
<string>Yomogi, Maido, Kinako, Shiratama, Azuki—<lf>they're all my purr-recious kittens.
<string>Every last one's a hard worker, and they<lf>grow more skilled by the day... They<lf>won't even need me before long.
<string>Oh, but I ain't throwin' in the apron<lf>just yet. Do what you love, and you<lf>never work a day in your life, they say!
<string>It's just, I've never taken the time to see<lf>what the world has to offer. Maybe I could<lf>go for a culinary tour outside Kamura.
<string>That day's gonna come soon enough.<lf>The idea leaves a sweet and sour taste<lf>in my meow-th, but I ain't complaining!
<string>Welcome back, <PL>.<lf>Here for some Bunny Dango?
<string>Not knocking what Elgado's got to offer,<lf>mind. Hopping between shops just lights<lf>a rivalrous fire under us culinarians.
<string>So then, what'll it be? A few meow-rsels<lf>to go?
