<string>Not only are Lady Fiorayne and Lady<lf>Rondine sisters, but knights famed fur<lf>their skills! A shock fur you, I'm sure!
<string>Wow, I'm so glad we don't have to meow-<lf>squerade around as traders anymore. I can<lf>tell you all about Rondine's adventures!
<string>Now then, allow me to explain how our Lady<lf>made a name fur herself in the Kingdom!<lf>Shouldn't take more than a few hours!
<string>Well, well, look what the Felyne<lf>dragged in! Looking to take a break<lf>fur-om your labors in Elgado?
<string>Or maybe you just came for a delightful<lf>eyeful of our Lady Rondine! I could<lf>hardly fault you fur the temptation.
<string>Burn the sight of her chivalrous charm<lf>into your eyes.
<string>That being said, it's rude to stare at a<lf>lady. So drink in her countenance—just<lf>remember to purr-take responsibly.
<string>Lady Rondine and Lady Fiorayne are<lf>a most courageous pair of knights,<lf>devoted to their duties.
<string>Our Lady is calm and collected, while<lf>her sister purr-ioritizes completing her<lf>mission, by any means necessary.
<string>They are both deserving of the highest<lf>titles and decorations that could be<lf>bestowed upon a knight...
<string>Yet I admit, Lady Fiorayne's methods<lf>disregard herself on occasion. And I have<lf>found myself worried about Lady Rondine.
<string>Purr-haps my concerns are unfounded...<lf>Those two ARE always looking out for<lf>each other.
<string>Since Lady Fiorayne has fallen ill,<lf>I have made up my mind!
<string>It's finally time for me to overcome<lf>my fear of the Toadversary!
<string>Once I've bested my phobia, surely Lady<lf>Fiorayne will conquer her own trial!
<string>Such a ritual is considered a vow where<lf>we come from.
<string>I'll challenge the Toadversary every<lf>day, until Lady Fiorayne recovers.<lf>I shall be victorious!
<string>Night after night, I took on the<lf>Toadversary in the hopes of getting over<lf>my fears. Every attempt ended in failure.
<string>I remember the time when I fainted<lf>and woke up in Lady Rondine's lap...
<string>Her smile was like a warm blanket, and<lf>she consoled me with empathy. "Good<lf>job in there," she said.
<string>It seems while I was fighting the<lf>Toadversary, Lady Fiorayne had<lf>made a complete recovery.
<string>I'm happy to hear that, really I am,<lf>but I'm still just as scared of that<lf>in-fur-nal machine...
<string>Both Lady Fiorayne and Lady Rondine<lf>had an audience with the Queen and<lf>purr-aised your deeds in Elgado.
<string>They reported your accomplishments<lf>including your deeds in Kamew-ra.<lf>I'm sure Her Majesty is pleased.
<string>Not only did you save your home from<lf>calamity, you also saved the Kingdom<lf>from cat-astrophe.
<string>The next time you're summeowned to<lf>the Kingdom, I'm sure they'll roll meow-t<lf>the red carpet for you!
