<string>Fire-breathing female wyverns, also known as<lf>the "Queens of the Land." With powerful legs<lf>and poison-secreting tails, they hunt mainly<lf>on the ground. Sometimes seen preying as a<lf>couple, Rathian and Rathalos cooperate well.
<string>The strong venom in her tail, along with the wide<lf>reach of her sweeping attacks, makes maneuvering<lf>around the Rathian a dangerous feat. Cutting off her<lf>tail can give you quite a bit more breathing room.
<string>A Rathian so mighty, it was crowned an Apex. Its<lf>body is covered in scars and wounds as if it had<lf>been caught in a storm, and it's seemingly always<lf>dominated by wrath and terror. Its tail oozes a<lf>venom far deadlier than any of a normal monster.<lf>The call of an Apex unleashes its tortured anger<lf>on nearby beasts, driving them into a frenzy.
<string>An angry Apex Rathian will trigger a devastating<lf>move, spraying poisonous thorns in all directions,<lf>creating toxic fields wherever they land. Push on<lf>against an enraged Apex to quickly rid it of its<lf>rage and steady its temper.
<string>Terrible wyverns called "Kings of the Skies."<lf>Along with Rathian, they stake wide territories<lf>centered around their nests. Rathalos descend<lf>on invaders from the sky, attacking with poison<lf>claws and a breath of fire.
<string>The King of the Skies lives up to its name by<lf>staying airborne for most of its attacks. A well-<lf>aimed <COL RED>Flash Bomb<COL RED> can help to bring a Rathalos<lf>down to earth, however.
<string>A Rathalos so mighty, it was crowned an Apex.<lf>Its body is covered in scars and wounds as if it<lf>had been caught in a storm, and it's seemingly<lf>always dominated by wrath and terror. Its every<lf>breath releases flaming jets that singe the very<lf>air. The call of an Apex unleashes its tortured<lf>anger on nearby beasts, driving them into a frenzy.
<string>An angry Apex Rathalos will trigger a devastating<lf>move, blasting a terrifying breath, destroying<lf>everything around it. Push on against an enraged<lf>Apex to quickly rid it of its rage and steady<lf>its temper.
<string>Loathsome wyverns that dwell in caves and other<lf>dark places. All but blind, Khezu hunt by smell.<lf>Their tail has evolved to cling to walls and ceilings.<lf>After using an electric shock to paralyze their prey,<lf>they extend their long neck and pounce.
<string>The Khezu will cling to walls or the ceiling<lf>to unleash its electric attacks from above.<lf>Use Wiredash to get to it and knock it down,<lf>or exhaust it to weaken its electricity.
<string>These juvenile Gravios are famous for their<lf>rock-hard carapaces. They often burrow<lf>underground, mimicking rocks and savaging<lf>oblivious miners. Because their carapaces<lf>are tougher than that of a full-grown Gravios,<lf>they'll attack a threat by charging at it. They<lf>are also known to emit a poisonous gas.
<string>Its thick, hardened shell is impervious to most<lf>attacks, making it tricky to approach, but if you<lf>can break its abdominal plating, you should be<lf>able to rip off its shell and deal some heavy hits.<lf>Attacks that produce heat will soften up the hide<lf>and make the job easier.
<string>Known as the "Tyrant of the Desert." The Diablos<lf>is extremely territorial and will use its massive horns<lf>to charge at invaders. Diablos have the ability to burrow<lf>underground and use this ability to strike from below,<lf>however, their sensitive ears make them susceptible<lf>to <COL RED>Sonic Bombs</COL>. Despite their predatory appearance,<lf>they are herbivorous and mostly feed on cactus.
<string>Diablos can be forcibly brought to the surface by<lf>using loud sounds. And its charging attack, while<lf>devastatingly powerful, can be baited into colliding<lf>with anthills, momentarily getting the Diablos<lf>stuck.
<string>A Diablos so mighty, it was crowned an Apex.<lf>Its body is covered in scars and wounds as if it<lf>had been caught in a storm, and it's seemingly<lf>always dominated by wrath and terror. Its well-<lf>developed horns add to the lethality of its charge.<lf>The call of an Apex unleashes its tortured anger<lf>on nearby beasts, driving them into a frenzy.
<string>An angry Apex Diablos will trigger a devastating<lf>move, launching into an unstoppable charge,<lf>bringing down everything that stands in its path.<lf>Push on against an enraged Apex to quickly rid<lf>it of its rage and steady its temper.
<string>An ultra-aggressive creature that is rarely sighted<lf>and seldom survived. Those that have survived<lf>report that it exhibits a strange attack. Rajang<lf>are said to be loners, and this isolated life has<lf>made it difficult to pin down its territorial leanings.<lf>When angered, part of its pelt turns a golden color.
<string>A Rajang is most dangerous when its arms are<lf>powered up, allowing it to even destroy <COL RED>Shock<lf>Traps</COL>. Attack its tail to remove this effect. In<lf>its regular state, it will also avoid <COL RED>Pitfall Traps</COL>.<lf>It will immediately attack anything that invades<lf>its territory, so watch your step.
<string>It's difficult to even get close to one of these<lf>metallic elder dragons, but some claim better<lf>odds if the creature is weakened with poison,<lf>or has its horn broken, limiting the amount of<lf>wind pressure it can muster.
<string>Beckons dark dragon wind pressure as the whirlwinds<lf>surrounding its body seethe more wildly, and will<lf>deflect any non-piercing bow or bowgun shots not<lf>aimed at its head. Keep on the attack to quell the<lf>wind's power—reports also tell of an opening in its<lf>stormy barrier after unleashing a giant wind attack.
<string>Precious few sightings of this elder dragon<lf>have been recorded, leading to claims<lf>it can vanish into its environment like<lf>a chameleon—hence its name. Witnesses report<lf>that, when enraged, it can spew a fog-like breath,<lf>which seems to come out of nowhere, and enhance its<lf>strength by licking the pollen from Petalaces.
<string>Chameleos have a meddlesome tendency to vanish<lf>suddenly, but by watching their attacks just before<lf>they do, you can somewhat predict where they'll<lf>reappear. Furthermore, there are eye-witness<lf>reports of a Chameleos not being able to vanish<lf>after its horn on the tip of its nose had been broken.
<string>Brutal elder dragons wreathed in flames<lf>that spew blazing fire. Teostra are of such<lf>a fierce and deadly nature that the Guild<lf>closely monitors their movements.
<string>The black scale dust a Teostra scatters will spread<lf>over a wide area until it finally explodes; however,<lf>reports claim that damaging the elder dragon's head<lf>can prevent the larger explosions. Push on the attack<lf>when it's fully enveloped in flames or scale dust to<lf>stun it, suppressing whichever it was accumulating.
<string>Flying wyverns whose primitive origins are obvious.<lf>Prone to violence, they display incredible ferocity<lf>with their claws, jaws, and developed limbs. They<lf>inhabit a wide area searching for prey, and have<lf>even been spotted in regions of harsh cold.
<string>The Tigrex's charge is swift, vicious, and far-<lf>reaching. During the hunt, keep to its side to<lf>stay outside its range; let it keep charging<lf>and eventually it will tire and slow down,<lf>opening itself up to your counterattack.
<string>Flying wyverns that have evolved to live in<lf>thickly wooded areas. Covered in jet black<lf>fur, these cunning predators stalk their prey<lf>from the shadows and attack with ferocious<lf>speed. Their massive tails are as dexterous<lf>as they are deadly, and powerful enough to<lf>slay smaller monsters with one strike.
<string>The Nargacuga is a beast of the shadows, and becomes<lf>enraged by bright light. At the risk of missing the<lf>mark and simply riling it up further, its excellent<lf>hearing can be exploited by throwing a <COL RED>Sonic Bomb</COL><lf>as it pauses to focus. It can destroy <COL RED>Pitfall Traps</COL>,<lf>so be discreet when placing them.
<string>Wyverns that rule the eternally frozen Tundra.<lf>Barioth use their forelegs, tail and their spiked<lf>scales to traverse the slippery ice with ease; this<lf>ability makes them very difficult to keep up with.
<string>Destroy the spikes on its winged forelegs and it<lf>won't be as zippy on the ice anymore! If you really<lf>want to slow a Barioth down, aim at those spikes.
<string>Barroth usually remain beneath the mud, perhaps<lf>to shield themselves from heat; they are even<lf>known to attack by flinging mud. They will charge<lf>in a frenzy at anything that disturbs their bogs.
<string>If you get hit by the mud a Barroth flings around,<lf>you'll get muddy, which means that any pro hunter<lf>should prioritize attacking the muddy parts of the<lf>monster to clean it off! Once you've got rid of all<lf>that mud, fighting it will be some good, clean fun!
<string>Larger than regular Ludroth, Royal Ludroth use<lf>their sponge-like mane to absorb water and keep<lf>from drying out on land. Once the sponge loses<lf>moisture, they will seek out water to recover.<lf>They also spew mucus to trip up their prey.
<string>The Royal Ludroth's attacks are empowered when<lf>in proximity of water, and can inflict foes with water-<lf>blight. Combat this by stocking up on <COL RED>Nulberries</COL><lf>and drawing the creature away from aquatic areas.
<string>A carnivorous bird wyvern. Noted for their<lf>projecting cranial crests and bluish-white<lf>skin that's adapted to snowy climates.<lf>Great Baggi craftily command other Baggi<lf>to surround their prey and stun them with<lf>a tranquilizing fluid.
<string>It commands many lesser Baggi to form a wave of<lf>all-out offense; a tactful hunter will pick off the herd<lf>one by one and avoid being surrounded. The Great<lf>Baggi spits out a sedative venom that will knock you<lf>out if you're struck by it, but having <COL RED>Energy Drinks</COL><lf>on hand helps offset that threat.
<string>Fanged wyverns whose bodies are streaked with<lf>electricity. Sharp claws and strong limbs allow them<lf>to thrive in mountainous terrain. During hunts, they<lf>gather numerous Thunderbugs to boost their power<lf>and enter a supercharged state.
<string>In their supercharged states, Zinogre not only have<lf>different attack patterns but also become faster,<lf>hit harder, and gain immunity to <COL RED>Shock Traps</COL>.<lf>Staggering them, however, may knock them<lf>out of this state.
<string>A Zinogre so mighty, it was crowned an Apex. Its<lf>body is covered in scars and wounds as if it had<lf>been caught in a storm, and it's seemingly always<lf>dominated by wrath and terror. Its forelegs—and<lf>their every strike—brim with ferocious sparks.<lf>The call of an Apex unleashes its tortured anger<lf>on nearby beasts, driving them into a frenzy.
<string>An angry Apex Zinogre will trigger a devastating move,<lf>causing a lightning strike upon the Thunderbugs<lf>it controls, after which it will pounce viciously on<lf>its prey. Push on against an enraged Apex to<lf>quickly rid it of its rage and steady its temper.
<string>Wroggi are bird wyverns that travel in packs that<lf>are led by the largest and most toxic member.<lf>Be careful when one raises its head and its<lf>poison sac expands—that signals that it's<lf>about to spit a cloud of poisonous mist.
<string>Remember to bring some <COL RED>Antidotes</COL> to deal<lf>with its poison. Taking out the sac around<lf>a Great Wroggi's neck will also prevent it<lf>from producing venom, so aim for the head.
<string>Beasts known to dwell in humid forest and<lf>mountain regions. Though known more for<lf>fishing and standing upright to collect honey,<lf>their thick claws and heavy forearm plating<lf>allow them to deliver powerful blows to any<lf>aggressor.
<string>Arzuros love <COL RED>honey</COL> so much that they may<lf>steal any you might be carrying and start<lf>to eat it on the spot, leaving them vulnerable.<lf>Carry around a stash of honey to take exploit<lf>their sweet tooth.
<string>An Arzuros so mighty, it was crowned an Apex.<lf>Its body is covered in scars and wounds as if it<lf>had been caught in a storm, and it's seemingly<lf>always dominated by wrath and terror. Its forelegs<lf>are massive, deft removers of any who'd stand in<lf>their way. The call of an Apex unleashes its tortured<lf>anger on nearby beasts, driving them into a frenzy.
<string>An angry Apex Arzuros will trigger a devastating<lf>move, closing in while thrashing the ground,<lf>hitting obstacles with a colossal strike.<lf>Push on against an enraged Apex to quickly<lf>rid it of its rage and steady its temper.
<string>Fanged, long-eared beasts whose warm pelts<lf>and thick layers of fat help them survive in cold<lf>climates. Though mainly herbivores, Lagombi<lf>occasionally make use of their exceptional hearing<lf>and ability to glide on ice to sneak up on prey.
<string>A Lagombi has very sensitive hearing, and <COL RED>Sonic<lf>Bombs</COL> will cause it to flinch in pain. Time a well-<lf>aimed throw for when it's sliding around, and<lf>you may topple it. When enraged, however,<lf>Sonic Bombs have no effect on it.
<string>Fanged beasts with thick red carapaces that<lf>are resistant to lava. Their rounded bodies are<lf>perfect for rolling across hot surfaces, and their<lf>long tongues are ideal for capturing insect prey.<lf>Their saliva emits a paralyzing toxin that should<lf>be avoided.
<string>The toxin that Volvidon spit out can paralyze on<lf>contact. You'll also want to carry some <COL RED>Deodorant</COL>,<lf>as the gas they emit can cover you in a stench so<lf>powerful that it makes it impossible to stomach<lf>anything.
<string>A specially evolved Leviathan with a sleek,<lf>lithe body, Mizutsune can secrete a peculiar<lf>foam that covers its foes in immobilizing bubbles.<lf>Once its prey's movement is impaired, it closes<lf>in with spry, dance-like movements.
<string>A Mizutsune slicks itself up to do a sliding attack,<lf>but its sliding also makes it susceptible to falling<lf>over, providing an opening for attack. If you're hit<lf>by its bubbles, you can scrub them off by running<lf>around and dodging furiously, or using a <COL RED>Cleanser</COL>.
<string>A Mizutsune so mighty, it was crowned an Apex.<lf>Its body is covered in scars and wounds as if it<lf>had been caught in a storm, and it's seemingly<lf>always dominated by wrath and terror. Its bubbles<lf>and huge tail have no trouble sending foes packing.<lf>The call of an Apex unleashes its tortured anger<lf>on nearby beasts, driving them into a frenzy.
<string>An angry Apex Mizutsune will trigger a devastating<lf>move, wreaking havoc to its surroundings by shooting<lf>out explosive bubbles. These can be dealt with<lf>by using <COL RED>kunai</COL>, ranged weapon shots, or ballistae.<lf>Push on against an enraged Apex to quickly<lf>rid it of its rage and steady its temper.
<string>A mutant Valstrax fearsomely dubbed the "Crimson<lf>Glow." This elder dragon typically secludes itself<lf>in the upper atmosphere, but it has been driven mad<lf>by its own rampant energy, causing it to lash out at<lf>anything in its sight. Once it sights its prey, it<lf>swoops down, trampling them beneath its shifting<lf>wingblades. Several have been sighted all over, so<lf>be prepared to encounter one at any time.
<string>After channeling energy into its wings, it will<lf>unleash a powerful attack. It sucks in this energy<lf>from its chest, and that's the moment to wait for.<lf>Prevent it from powering up<lf>and cause the energy to combust, dealing serious<lf>damage to the creature.
<string>A monster with a carapace like tempered steel armor.<lf>The vapor around it is actually the expelling of trapped<lf>gases from the hordes of monsters Magnamalo has<lf>consumed. This has earned it the moniker "Wyvern of<lf>Malice." Its shrouded swings can inflict hellfireblight,<lf>which causes one to combust either spontaneously<lf>or when hit. Use a <COL RED>Deodorant</COL> or a Wirebug to rid<lf>yourself of hellfire.
<string>The majority of Magnamalo's attacks involve its hellfire.<lf>If you become afflicted with hellfireblight, Wiredash to<lf>rid yourself of this status. You can counter its attacks<lf>by focusing on parts of its body that are emitting hellfire.<lf>If you can manage to ignite any of the vapor with your<lf>attacks, you can deal massive damage.
<string>A monster with a distinctive tail. While it is<lf>omnivorous, it has a preference for fruit,<lf>and keeps various fruits with all kinds of<lf>effects in its belly pouch. An incredibly<lf>curious beast, it enjoys playing tricks on<lf>people, and has been seen to bat fruit at<lf>its prey using its tail.
<string>Its varied tail attacks are incredibly powerful, and<lf>sometimes it spins around like a top, so avoiding<lf>damage can be tough. But, if you use that chance to<lf>attack, the beast will drop its fruit, and you can<lf>pick it up and throw it back, aiding your hunt.<lf>Watch its moves carefully to find your opening.
<string>Tending to stand on one leg, this monster somewhat<lf>resembles an umbrella. The Aknosom is highly<lf>territorial; it will spread out its wings and show<lf>off its characteristic comb to scare off threats. It<lf>also bears flammable venom that burns fiercely and<lf>lingers on the ground when lit. Draw the beast to<lf>water for an easier fight.
<string>It can manipulate the umbrella-shaped crest on its<lf>head to curl up, fan out, or shut tight. Observe<lf>its shape closely, and you might be able to predict<lf>which attack it will use next.
<string>An amphibious monster resembling a frog. Its appetite<lf>is infinite, and if it sees anything moving, it will gobble<lf>it up, dirt an all. It's theorized that the dirt it consumes<lf>builds up in its stomach and aids in digestion. If it eats<lf>something that it cannot digest, it will throw it back up.<lf>The cranial disc protecting its tender head is said to<lf>harden and become a more brilliant blue over time.
<string>After a large meal, its movements become sluggish,<lf>but don't be fooled; its swings become more weighty<lf>and destructive as well! Watch for when it moves<lf>slowly, strike true, and it'll belch up its dinner<lf>and return to normal.
<string>A formidable aquatic serpent that crests on moonlit<lf>nights—likely why it has often been mistaken for a<lf>mermaid. It expels an intoxicating sleep powder from<lf>its neck gills and tail, knocking out prey before it can<lf>resist. Some Somnacanth sightings tell of this species<lf>making use of unusual shells, so exercise caution if<lf>you catch one swimming towards you with a shell<lf>in its claws.
<string>While in the water, it can move about as it pleases,<lf>but it doesn't fare so well on land, so draw it out<lf>to shore for an easy hunt. If you're caught in a cloud<lf>of its sleep powder, it's lights out; use a Wirebug to<lf>leap away from it and position for a counterattack.
<string>A Rakna-Kadaki is usually seen covered in sticky<lf>webbing. Clinging to its abdomen are its offspring,<lf>known as Rachnoid, which it controls using the<lf>flammable gas that builds up there. Rachnoid spit<lf>fire, capture prey, and support the Rakna-Kadaki's<lf>massive body. As their numbers dwindle, the beast<lf>will hatch more, at which point it is extremely<lf>dangerous.
<string>It moves quickly by tethering webs to its offspring,<lf>but a strike timed well enough to sever these threads<lf>will cause the Rakna-Kadaki to lose its balance and<lf>provide you an opening. If, however, you become<lf>entangled in its web and roasted by its flames,<lf>expect to take a significant amount of damage.
<string>As its name implies, Almudron spends a great deal<lf>of time lurking in mud—at least until it emerges<lf>to smother approaching prey. From its tail oozes<lf>a strange golden fluid, which Almudron uses to<lf>dissolve the ground beneath its prey, arresting<lf>them in a mire so that it can drag them under.<lf>When enraged, it produces more fluid, turning<lf>the mud golden. When you see gold, watch out!
<string>The mud-covered tail is what makes this species strong;<lf>attacking this outer layer will chip away at it, so<lf>removing this muddy shroud should be your priority.<lf>The gold-glimmering mud is harmful to the touch, so<lf>mind the color of your surroundings while hunting<lf>these beasts.
<string>A male elder dragon that exhibits inexplicable<lf>behaviors such as floating upside down midair.<lf>Research indicates that the emission of a special gas<lf>from all over its body, and the modulation of this<lf>gas, is what allows it to move freely. It shoots air<lf>from gills on its arms and tail to fly, creating its<lf>own turbulence and soaring to great heights.
<string>It possesses special organs called "windsacs" that store<lf>the gas it uses to float, and can be seen on its<lf>back, and tail. They are very delicate, and injuring<lf>them could open up a prime opportunity to attack.
<string>A monster native to ice-cold climates. Covered in<lf>fur so thick it keeps out the harsh frost, it roams<lf>the snowy plains in search of prey. It can inhale<lf>the cold air to freeze its own bodily fluids and<lf>then spit them out to create icy blades on its<lf>arms. When riled up, the Goss Harag turns red<lf>and becomes exceedingly dangerous.
<string>In hitting the accumulated frost on its forelegs, a<lf>hunter risks being afflicted with iceblight, but is<lf>rewarded by the creature being toppled when the<lf>frost is shattered. Areas that appear red when<lf>the creature is angry are the most susceptible,<lf>so focus your efforts there!
<string>The alpha Izuchi of its pack, identified by its<lf>larger build, upended white fur and scythe-like<lf>tail. A Great Izuchi forms a herd of many smaller<lf>Izuchi and selects two from the group to accompany<lf>it on territory patrols. Once it spots prey or senses<lf>danger, the Great Izuchi issues commands to their<lf>fellow Izuchi, and coordinates their movements.<lf>Take care that you don't get overwhelmed.
<string>Their razor-sharp tail attacks in combination with<lf>their synchronicity make them a force to be reckoned<lf>with. Take out their leader to send the herd into<lf>disarray and pick them off easily.
<string>An elder dragon and Wind Serpent Ibushi's "queen."<lf>Its thundersacs glow with accumulated electrical<lf>charge; it is thought that these organs therefore<lf>generate the powerful magnetic field that lifts the<lf>creature and anything around it high into the air.
<string>Attacking its thundersacs that have stored energy<lf>will cause them to discharge, grounding the beast.<lf>Those on its underside are its weakest, provided<lf>you can time an attack for when they aren't blocked<lf>by its fins. If you're crafty, you can even use the<lf>levitating terrain to your advantage.
<string>Having absorbed the lifeforce of her "king," Narwa<lf>has transformed and become imbued with new power.<lf>She now possesses Ibushi's mastery over wind as well<lf>as her own control over thunder, and lusts for utter<lf>annihilation.
<string>Narwa's ability to now command the wind like Ibushi<lf>as well as employ her usual attacks makes her twice<lf>as deadly. Keep your eye on her stance as she<lf>attacks so you aren't caught off guard. Attack the<lf>areas on her body that have accumulated energy to<lf>give yourself the edge over her.
<string>This belligerent monster will attack anything<lf>without hesitation. The membrane along its<lf>tail fans out when it is provoked—a behavior<lf>theorized to be either an act of intimidation<lf>or thermoregulation, as it has been known to<lf>do so when it breathes fire.
<string>Anjanath spits fiery blasts from its mouth utilizing<lf>a unique organ in its throat when it is angered. When<lf>it does so, focus attacks on its throat to gain an edge.
<string>A bird wyvern known to store toxins within<lf>its body. It uses its tongue like a whip and<lf>can stretch or shrink it at will, allowing<lf>it to grab up food. As a defense against<lf>threats, Pukei-Pukei have numerous toxic<lf>attacks. Keep an eye on both its mouth<lf>and tail!
<string>The regurgitation of a Pukei-Pukei varies depending<lf>on what it has eaten: it may spread wider, linger on<lf>on the ground, or even stun prey more easily. Check,<lf>therefore, that the monster's mouth and tail aren't<lf>swollen prior to engaging.
<string>A bird wyvern that has developed limbs capable<lf>of carrying objects. It has been spotted stealing<lf>eggs from nests. If attacked while carrying an egg,<lf>it will drop the egg in fright and flee. When engaged,<lf>a Kulu-Ya-Ku will dig up a small boulder to shield<lf>itself against threats or use it in its attacks.
<string>A Kulu-Ya-Ku uses small boulders to shield itself or<lf>smash against its enemies. Force it to drop whatever<lf>it's holding by staggering or blinding it, or if it's<lf>holding a cracked boulder, attack it to break it.
<string>A piscine wyvern that inhabits swamps,<lf>utilizing the mud there to hunt and survive.<lf>It wallows in the mire to maximize cutaneous<lf>respiration and preserve the toughness of its<lf>scales. The sludge it spits is highly viscous, so<lf>watch where you step, lest you get stuck in it.
<string>A Jyuratodus's mud-caked carapace is tough, so use<lf>water-elemental weapons to dissolve the mud and get<lf>to its squishy core. Stepping in its mud slows you<lf>down, so pay attention to your footing.
<string>A fanged wyvern that flies among the treetops.<lf>Its penchant to brush against the ground and<lf>the trees as it moves around builds up static<lf>electricity within its fur. This action allows it to<lf>reach a charged state—identified by its glowing<lf>fur—in which its head and tail attacks are said<lf>to be particularly lethal.
<string>Always keep the Tobi-Kadachi in your sights to avoid<lf>being ambushed from behind. The key to defeating<lf>this monster is to immobilize it and prevent it from<lf>reaching a charged state. If you can make use of<lf>endemic life to afflict it with waterblight, it'll<lf>no longer be able to charge itself up.
<string>A nefarious flying wyvern that travels the<lf>world in search of prey. It scatters its own<lf>explosive scales over a wide area to prey<lf>on whatever gets caught in the blast.<lf>In some places, this has earned it<lf>the nickname "Bomber Wyvern."
<string>The formidable scales that the Bazelgeuse scatters<lf>explode after receiving an impact but the time they<lf>take to regenerate can be used as a chance to attack.<lf>When its scales turn red hot, they will explode immediately<lf>and require caution, however, parts of the<lf>body will be soft too—the perfect time to attack.
<string>Small herbivores known for their gentle demeanor<lf>and the medicinal properties of their horns.<lf>Those wishing to harvest a horn should aim<lf>for the head when attacking them.
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> HN_MonsterListMsg_EnemyIndex048_page1
<string>Bipedal creatures resembling cats, known for their<lf>light hair. Though usually docile, they will attack<lf>viciously if provoked. Naturally curious, some try<lf>to enter human society, and are often hired by the<lf>Guild to cook for and otherwise assist hunters.
<string>Bipedal creatures resembling cats, known for their<lf>dark hair. More curious than Felynes and possessed<lf>by kleptomania, Melynxes take what they steal<lf>back to their dens.
<string>Large, wild boars with a foul temper. Fertile and<lf>wide-ranging, they have been known to form<lf>large herds. They are so aggressive that they<lf>will attack other members of their own herd<lf>if they don't recognize them. Those without a<lf>particular reason to hunt them are better<lf>off keeping their distance.
<string>Herd-forming herbivores covered in thick fur<lf>to endure the cold. Popo are gentle by nature,<lf>so if they are attacked the whole herd will<lf>turn tail and run. Popo meat is very nutritious;<lf>the tongue is said to be especially palatable.
<string>Herbivores that live in cold climates. Generally<lf>docile, though they have been known to attack<lf>when threatened. Their high-quality pelts have<lf>many uses, and their antlers are highly prized<lf>by the Guild. Simply stun the creatures<lf>to easily harvest one.
<string>Small but agile flying wyverns that seek out<lf>weakened creatures to attack. Often seen<lf>near elder dragons, they're considered a<lf>portent of disaster. Originally classified as<lf>flying wyverns, after further research they<lf>were reclassified as snake wyverns.
<string>Extremely territorial herbivores with poor vision<lf>but acute hearing, Rhenoplos will doggedly<lf>pursue any target they sense. They cannot<lf>easily stop once they break into a run, a fact<lf>confirmed by hunters who foolishly thought they<lf>could stop them using a buckler or a shield.
<string>Pervasive flying insects that attack invaders<lf>with paralyzing venom and lay eggs in carrion<lf>along with a fluid that hastens decomposition.<lf>It is best to kill them with poison so that<lf>their parts are left ripe for the carving.
<string>Insects that widely inhabit many areas. They absorb<lf>fruit, mushrooms, and honey, and then carry them<lf>back to their nest. Materials can thus be collected<lf>from their swollen abdomens, whose color is related<lf>to what they're carrying.
<string>Vicious piscine creatures that form groups to defend<lf>their territory from intruders. Though primarily<lf>aquatic creatures, they have been known to chase<lf>their prey onto land, before wriggling back to<lf>the banks and into the water. Be sure not to<lf>venture too closely to their habitat!
<string>Highly social, carnivorous bird wyverns that live<lf>in large packs. Young Jaggi males hunt in groups<lf>when attacking larger animals. Research suggests<lf>they operate under orders from a single alpha male.
<string>Female Jaggi that stay in packs, Jaggia generally<lf>live near the nest and are responsible for defending<lf>it and raising young. Smaller than mature males,<lf>but larger and tougher than the pack's countless<lf>young males. They also operate under orders<lf>from the alpha.
