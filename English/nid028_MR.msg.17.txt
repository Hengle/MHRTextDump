<string>Oh, it's you, <PL>!<lf>I heard the news! You're leaving the village<lf>to go off on a new hunting adventure!
<string>Talk about a shock! You've spent your<lf>whole life in Kamura, and now you're off<lf>to see the world...
<string>It's sort of moving, in a way. One day,<lf>perhaps, my little Seihaku will grow up<lf>and follow in your footsteps...
<string>Ah, but I doubt that boy will ever<lf>leave... Not while Komitsu is here,<lf>at least.
<string>Welcome back, <PL>!<lf>How're you faring over in the Outpost?<lf>Are you eating well?
<string>You know, I was wondering... What kind<lf>of food do they eat over there? I heard a<lf>silly rumor that all they eat is meat.
<string>I mean I'm a big fan of meat too, but you gotta<lf>have a balanced diet! Oh, I know! Why don't<lf>you take some of my veggies over there!
<string>How many boxes do you think you'll need?<lf>Hmmm...well, take eight for now. Or maybe<lf>ten? You know what, make it twenty.
<string>So the Tea Shop over in the Outpost is all<lf>set up? I know Azuki had a lot of help from<lf>Otemai and Yomogi before she set off.
<string>And you better believe that my veggies<lf>are there, too, which makes them 100%<lf>authentic Kamura Bunny Dango!
<string>I bet those outpost people love them, too!<lf>How can they not? The excellence of our<lf>dango isn't opinion—it's fact!
<string>Oh, <PL>.<lf>I heard a terrifying monster has<lf>appeared near Elgado, is it true?
<string>After all the pain and suffering we went<lf>through with the Rampage, stories like<lf>these worry me to death.
<string>Is there anything we can do for them?<lf>Do they need anything? Supplies?<lf>Veggies? They definitely need veggies!
<string>If anything happens, just let us know.<lf>And let the people of Elgado know<lf>that Kamura is here for them!
<string><VO:SER>Oh! <PL>! Are you OK!?<lf>You're all healed up already!?
<string>I heard a monster attacked and you got<lf>hurt— Huh? That wasn't you?
<string><VO:NOR>Oh, um, OK...<lf>Maybe I heard wrong then. Sorry...<lf>...Talk about embarrassing!
<string>Well, the fact remains that someone did get<lf>hurt. Was it someone you know? You must be<lf>worried... Well, I hope they get better soon!
<string>Minoto just told me a tasty tidbit... My<lf>Seihaku has been serious about training<lf>his bow arm lately. Hehehe.
<string>Since you left, he's been thinking nonstop<lf>about how he can protect Komitsu.
<string>I'll have to thank that girl somehow!<lf>Whenever he gets serious about<lf>something, it's always for her sake.
<string>Hmmm... You think I could get her<lf>to say, "Boys who help out their<lf>mommies are dreamy," or something?
<string>Our hero returns! Sounds like you've<lf>been out there making waves! And<lf>having a blast doing it too!
<string>The Flame of Kamura! The hero of<lf>the village—no, the whole continent!
<string>And just in case you haven't noticed,<lf>the kids are all super excited that<lf>you're back!
<string>Of course Seihaku talks about you<lf>nonstop. He tries to act tough and hide<lf>his enthusiasm, but you know how he is.
<string>Do me a favor, would ya? Spend a little<lf>time with him when you can. You know<lf>it'd mean the world to him.
<string>We can't relax just yet, but as<lf>long as we have you, <PL><lf>I know we have nothing to fear.
