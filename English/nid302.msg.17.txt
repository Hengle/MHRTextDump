<string>Oh man...
<string><FCAM><NOFAC><VO:SER>Oh, <PL>.<lf>Thanks for coming.
<string>Remember how Yomogi's supplier<lf>got held up at the Shrine Ruins,<lf>and you helped them out? Well...
<string>I'm not sure why, but since then, a lot<lf>more monster have been acting really<lf>weird around the Ruins.
<string>I know monsters get fidgety when the<lf>Rampage nears, but it's strange that<lf>they'd all congregate in the same spot.
<string>Plus the merchant mentioned "a strange<lf>presence," and now the village's talking<lf>about ghosts. Creepy, right?
<string>Anyway, this eager Canyne and Felyne<lf>heard about it, and... They ran off to<lf>the Ruins to "hunt down this presence."
<string>And now, I hear an <COL RED>Aknosom</COL><lf>has shown up there!
<string>Please, <PL>!<lf>Will you take care of that Aknosom<lf>while I go search for the Buddies!?
<string>You can accept the urgent quest<lf>from Hinoa. Please, I need your help!
<string><FCAM><NOFAC>Hey, <PL>!<lf>Thanks to you, I could find those<lf>Buddies and bring them home safely!
<string>Thank you so much.<lf>I... I really can't thank you enough.
<string>The Felyne we rescued said something<lf>interesting. That Aknosom at the Ruins<lf>seemed like it was "fleeing" something...
<string>Maybe it had been fighting with<lf>another monster over territory?<lf>At least...I hope that's the case.
<string>Oh, by the way! This isn't much,<lf>but here. Just to say thank you<lf>for helping out with those Buddies.
<string>You know, I bet someday you'll be<lf>the best hunter who's ever lived!<lf>Keep it up!
<string><NOFAC>Hey, <PL>!<lf>I heard you're a Kamura Hunter now.<lf>Congratulations!
<string>So, this is the Buddy Scout. Here,<lf>you can hire trusty Buddies who'll<lf>accompany you on your hunt.
<string>They're all great too and eager<lf>to join you out there in the field.
<string>Come by whenever you need something<lf>Buddy-related, OK?
<string>Hey, <PL>.<lf>Starting your hunting life, huh?
<string>Then why not take a Buddy with you?<lf>They'll always be there to help make<lf>your hunts a lot easier.
<string>Hello, <PL>!<lf>How did Master Utsushi's quest go?
<string>Master Utsushi was so excited<lf>about it. He said he'd been working<lf>on it for more than a year!
<string>He always used to say, "My numero uno<lf>pupil WILL be a hunter, I know it!" even<lf>before you were set to become one.
<string>We never doubted you either,<lf>but I guess Utsushi knew you'd<lf>succeed more than anyone else.
<string>So everything is back to normal<lf>at the Tea Shop? That's great to<lf>hear, <PL>!
<string>Honestly, I thought Hinoa was gonna pass out,<lf>she was so stressed over the whole ordeal. You<lf>know how crazy she is about those dango!
<string><VO:SER>Two of my Buddies ran off to the Shrine<lf>Ruins to scare away those "ghosts"<lf>everyone's been talking about...
<string>But we got word that an Aknosom's<lf>also there and I'm afraid something<lf>bad might happen to those two!
<string>Please, <PL>!<lf>Can you take care of that Aknosom<lf>while I go look for those Buddies!?
<string>Thank you so much, <PL>!<lf>Luckily, I found our Buddies just in time and<lf>they were able to escape that Aknosom's wrath...
<string>Unfortunately, they weren't able to escape<lf>Elder Fugen's wrath. He sure gave them an<lf>earful! I've never seen ears droop so low!
<string>They mentioned something really weird<lf>though... Said that Aknosom looked like<lf>it was "fleeing" something.
<string>Thank you so much, <PL>!<lf>Luckily, I found our Buddies just in time and<lf>they were able to escape that Aknosom's wrath...
<string>Unfortunately, they weren't able to escape<lf>Elder Fugen's wrath. He sure gave them an<lf>earful! I've never seen ears droop so low!
<string><VO:SER>They mentioned something really weird<lf>though... Said that Aknosom looked like<lf>it was "fleeing" something.
<string>So...the Rampage has come.
<string>I've been training with everyone to be<lf>a defender, so I'm gonna be there at<lf>the Stronghold too.
<string><VO:SER>I don't think my grandfather is fully<lf>on board with the idea, though.
<string>N-Not that it matters to me! I'm an adult<lf>who can make his own decisions. And<lf>my decision is to fight for Kamura!
<string><VO:SER>Hmm...
<string>"Kamura is more than steel and hunters."<lf>How can that be true? What can I do other<lf>than fight!?
<string>I...I just don't get it. If the danger Kamura<lf>faces are the monsters that attack it, how<lf>else am I to protect it?
<string><VO:SER>Magnamalo... My grandfather stood against<lf>that beast fifty years ago.
<string>And yet, he was unable to defeat it.
<string>It's hard to believe that even a legendary<lf>hunter such as my grandfather couldn't<lf>beat Magnamalo...
<string><PL>,<lf>Please, don't push yourself too much, OK?
<string>My grandfather has made a device that's<lf>supposed to help defeat Magnamalo.
<string>That's his way of protecting Kamura<lf>as a blacksmith and as a craftsman...
<string>I guess my grandfather's spelling it<lf>out for me...
<string>And I think I get it now—what<lf>"Kamura is more than steel<lf>and hunters" really means.
<string>Magnamalo's isolated right now,<lf>thanks to my grandfather's device.
<string><PL>.<lf>Please, take down Magnamalo.<lf>For my grandfather's sake.
<string>Only then, I think I'll know if<lf>the conclusion I've come to<lf>is really right or not.
<string>"Kamura is more than steel and hunters."<lf>I think I finally understand it now.
<string>I've always enjoyed being a Buddy<lf>Scout, but now I feel a little more<lf>confident about it.
<string>And it's in part thanks to you defeating<lf>Magnamalo.<lf>Thank you, <PL>.
<string>From now on, I'm going to protect this<lf>village by helping you and other hunters<lf>as THE go-to Buddy Scout.
<string>My grandpa's been asking me recently<lf>about my job as Buddy Scout.
<string>Well...sometimes. Like, occasionally.
<string>Still, I know he didn't approve of<lf>my job until now, so...even if he's<lf>mildly interested, I'm so glad.
<string>I'm pretty sure it's thanks to you.<lf>When Kamura's safe, how would you<lf>like to have dinner with us?
<string>...And I'm totally not asking because<lf>I feel awkward eating alone with just<lf>my grandfather.
<string>My grandfather sometimes goes out<lf>to have a drink with Master Hojo<lf>and Elder Fugen.
<string>It's kind of cool, don't you think?<lf>I wanna do something like that<lf>when I get older.
<string><PL>,<lf>have you ever heard Master Utsushi<lf>do his monster impressions?
<string>He's really good at it. It's so realistic.
<string>And it's a great help with Buddy Training.<lf>Whenever he acts like a monster, they improve<lf>so much more quickly! It's pretty incredible!
<string>But sometimes, a Buddy will get scared<lf>and hide because his impressions are<lf>too good. Hahaha! Cute, right?

<string><VO:SER>I heard news came into the Hub<lf>that there's an Apex Arzuros leading<lf>a horde of rampaging monsters.
<string>According to my grandfather, Apex<lf>monsters have a unique control over<lf>the monsters that follow them.
<string>Sounds interesting, but also sounds dangerous...<lf>Please be careful.
<string><VO:SER>When we got back to the village,<lf>Hinoa's face was pale as a ghost.<lf>And everyone started to freak out...
<string>She seems fine now. But if that blue<lf>monster shows itself again...
<string>We have to do something about it!
<string>Elder Fugen, Master Hojo, and my grandfather<lf>have been thinking about a way to end the<lf>Rampage. Not just this time, but permanently.
<string>Honestly, I dunno if that's possible.<lf>We don't really know a whole lot about<lf>the Rampage, not even what causes it.
<string>But if it could somehow be ended<lf>once and for all, it'd be a dream<lf>come true for everyone in Kamura.
<string>I would have never expected Hinoa to<lf>resonate with an elder dragon, let alone the<lf>one that is the very cause of the Rampage.
<string>You'll be the one going<lf>after it, won't you?
<string>Please, take care. A monster capable<lf>of causing such a calamity must be<lf>truly powerful.
<string>So, it's... It's time.
<string>My grandfather said, "If anyone<lf>can do it, <PL> can."<lf>And I agree.
<string>But please...come back safe, OK?
<string>Wow, <PL>!<lf>You actually chased Ibushi away!
<string>It looks like the Rampage hasn't ended,<lf>but if you ask me, a small step forward<lf>is definitely a victory worth celebrating!
<string>I'm not sure where we'll go from here,<lf>but I get the feeling that, as long as<lf>you're around, we're gonna be OK!
<string>I heard about what happened with Minoto,<lf>so I rushed over to the Gathering Hub.
<string>She looked...fine. Except for her eyes<lf>glowing yellow, which is totally weird.<lf>But, yeah, fine. Happy even.
<string>But if she's resonating with a monster too,<lf>we gotta go after it! Even though she seems<lf>fine, I'm not so sure, you know?
<string>You're the pride of Kamura,<lf>you know. Someone we all<lf>look up to. Especially me!
<string>You've helped so many of us.<lf>You're the coolest hunter I've ever met!
<string>So I know you'll come out on top,<lf>just like you always do.<lf>But still—please, be careful.
<string>I can't believe both Ibushi and Narwa are alive.<lf>I should have known better than to think we<lf>could get rid of the Rampage so easily...
<string>But you've beat them this far.<lf>I bet the next time they show up,<lf>you'll defeat them once and for all!
<string>Anyway, I'm just happy you're safe!<lf>Welcome back, <PL>.
<string>I wonder where Ibushi and Narwa are.
<string>Master Utsushi and everyone at the Guild<lf>are working hard to find them, but<lf>so far, no leads have turned up.
<string>The serpents have been searching<lf>for each other, right? It can't be good<lf>if they meet up...
<string>I guess we know where<lf>Ibushi and Narwa are...
<string>But with those two serpents together,<lf>grandpa says we have to stop them here<lf>and now, or there'll be even worse trouble.
<string>I know you'll save our village<lf>and come home safe, <PL>.<lf>Just...be careful...
<string>I hear we soon won't have to worry about<lf>the Rampage anymore, and that's down<lf>to you. Thank you... I really mean it.
<string>That party after you came home,<lf>all the singing and dancing...<lf>It was so much fun.
<string>Even grandpa drank so much he was hungover<lf>the next day. I don't think I've ever seen<lf>him let loose like that before.
<string>Heh, I guess he was just that happy.<lf>Anyway, <PL>, again: thank you. You<lf>really did something amazing—for all of us.
<string>It really is thanks to you that the Rampage<lf>is practically over, huh, <PL>?
<string>Maybe now, my parents<lf>can finally come home...
<string>Hey, when they do, we should all<lf>go grab some dango together!<lf>What do you think?
<string>Hey, do you know Tetsy?<lf>The baby Tetsucabra that Guild Master<lf>Hojo sits on in the Gathering Hub.
<string>Tetsy's real close with Master Hojo. It's like<lf>she thinks he's her dad or something. I mean...<lf>They do kind of resemble each other.
<string>Anyway, she hasn't warmed up to anyone<lf>else. Which kinda sucks. I really would<lf>like to play with her some time.
<string>Have you seen either of the Toadversaries<lf>in the Plaza or the Training Area?<lf>My grandfather made them for training.
<string>The one here in the Plaza's been<lf>decorated by the Buddies, so it's<lf>a bit different than the other one.
<string>Either way, I recommend giving them<lf>a try sometime!
<string>Master Inukai is friends with my parents,<lf>and they've been training Canynes since<lf>forever.
<string>He's a real nice person.<lf>He looks after me when<lf>my parents are out of town.
<string>And he knows everything there is<lf>to know about Canynes too. I learn<lf>so much just talking to him.
<string>It's been a while since I've seen<lf>my parents. They haven't been<lf>back to Kamura in ages it seems.
<string>They've been traveling around<lf>to different places teaching<lf>hunters about using Palamutes.
<string>Of course I miss them. But I have all<lf>the Buddies to keep me company. Not to<lf>mention Master Inukai and my grandfather.
<string>Have you met Rondine yet?<lf>She has her ship docked over<lf>there at the port.
<string>My grandfather says she's not just a trader,<lf>and I agree. She looks like she's ready<lf>to take on just about anything.
<string>But after talking to her a couple of<lf>times, you get to know who she is<lf>and why she's here.
<string>She's pretty cool actually!<lf>And it seems like she really<lf>likes Kamura.
<string>My parents have been traveling for a while<lf>now, going to different places, teaching<lf>hunters about using Canynes as Palamutes.
<string>The other day, they finally heard<lf>about the Rampage in Kamura.
<string>So they thought they should come<lf>back to Kamura. But my grandfather<lf>told them it's best if they didn't.
<string>I think it was the right thing to do.<lf>I mean, it's dangerous, and my parents<lf>aren't really fighters.
<string>I wish I could see them sooner, but<lf>it's better to wait until the Rampage<lf>is over.
<string>I heard that Kogarashi was Elder Fugen's<lf>Palico back when he was a hunter.
<string>And you can tell that he's been on<lf>a LOT of hunts.
<string>All of the Buddies, no matter<lf>how hot-headed they are, quiet down<lf>real quick when he's around.
<string>I wish had that same air of authority<lf>that he does.
<string>Hey, got some good news!
<string><NOFAC>It's amazing how you just knock every quest<lf>out of the park, <PL>.
<string>I wanted to support your efforts in<lf>some way, so I decided to scout<lf>more Buddies for you to hire!
<string>I figure that with a trusty Buddy at your<lf>side, no hunt could prove your match. So<lf>think about hiring a few new ones, OK?
<string>Hey, got some good news!
<string><NOFAC>Watching you go off on all these exciting<lf>adventures has the Buddies itching to get<lf>in on some action themselves.
<string>That's why I decided to scout even<lf>more Buddies for you to hire!
<string>It means a lot of paperwork and procedures,<lf>but if it'll make them happy, I don't mind.<lf>Think about hiring a few new ones, OK?
<string>Hey, got some good news!
<string><NOFAC>Oh, <PL>! Could you hear me out<lf>for a sec?
<string>The Buddies that weren't hired have been<lf>training together real hard, every day, and<lf>now they're a whole lot stronger.
<string>They really want to go hunting with<lf>you. Do you think you could check<lf>them out when you get a chance?
<string>Hey, got some good news!
<string><NOFAC>Oh, <PL>. Great timing!
<string>The Buddies that haven't been hired want to<lf>help protect Kamura so badly, they've been<lf>putting everything they've got into training.
<string>Chief Kogarashi even helped out, so they're<lf>really, really strong now! I'm sure they'd be<lf>a big help on your hunts.
<string>They're only restless here anyway.<lf>Why not take one of them out in<lf>the field with you?
