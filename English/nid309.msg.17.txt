<string>Meowllo there.<lf>My name is Kotori.
<string>As you can see, we're simple traders<lf>visiting Kamew-ra to do business.
<string>Our furless leader is Lady Rondine.<lf>If you have any trade inquiries,<lf>our Lady will be the one to ask.
<string>Paw shucks...<lf>Lady Rondine was purr-etty upset with<lf>me earlier because I almost blew our—
<string>Uh... I mean...because I haven't<lf>quite gotten the hang of this whole<lf>trader business!
<string>By the looks of you, I assume you're<lf>a hunter. And by the smell of you,<lf>you're a pretty good one.
<string>Still, nowhere skilled enough<lf>to rival my Lady Rondine. Her<lf>skills with the long sword are—
<string>Uh...
<string>Please fur-get what I just said.<lf>We're simple traders. Never<lf>touched a weapon in our life.
<string>The village kids come to say meowllo<lf>to Lady Rondine every so often.
<string>But there was this one kid who said,<lf>"She doesn't look like a merchant."
<string>Kids are purr-etty observant...<lf>Or purr-haps a lucky guess?<lf>Uh—
<string>I-I mean, you know, the, um, Lady...<lf>Sh-She's so pretty she doesn't look<lf>like a merchant! Yeah, that's it!

<string>I-I mean, you know, the, um, Lady...<lf>Sh-She's so pretty she doesn't look<lf>like a merchant! Yeah, that's it!
<string>This Rampage business is pawfully<lf>scary stuff...
<string>I wouldn't hesitate to take up paws in aid,<lf>except I fear a group of outsiders jumping<lf>in might do more harm than good.
<string>So instead, we're going to help by doing<lf>what traders do...which is trading. Not<lf>fighting. Because we're traders.
<string>Lady Rondine is truly incredible, able<lf>to form a detailed analysis of an elder<lf>dragon that's hardly known about.
<string>No wonder she is the Queen's—
<string>Uh...
<string>Th-The Queen's...uh, best trader! Yeah!<lf>You know, you travel around a lot. See<lf>a lot of things. Normal trader stuff.
<string>I'm from a peaceful land ruled by<lf>Her Majesty the Queen. But like this<lf>place, it's threatened by monsters.
<string>That's why hunters are given knighthood,<lf>sworn to protect the land and Queen.<lf>And Lady Rondine is one of the—
<string>Is...uh...<lf>One of the most well-known traders!
<string>Lady Rondine regards Kamew-ra Village<lf>with very high respect.
<string>She even pleaded to the Queen to let<lf>her fight alongside you against that<lf>meownster, but her request was denied.
<string>But that doesn't mean Her Majesty<lf>doesn't care about saving Kamew-ra.
<string>She trusts Lady Rondine very much,<lf>and she's worried about her. I hope<lf>you can understand her dilemma.
<string>I made another mistake again, but<lf>Lady Rondine didn't even notice.
<string>It was like she wasn't fully there...<lf>I think she's purr-etty concerned<lf>about this Wind Serpent Ibushi.
<string>Good luck to you, Hunter.<lf>Both the Lady and I will be purr-aying<lf>that Kamew-ra will be safe.
<string>Running away from a fight because<lf>you got hurt a little? Pfft, Ibushi<lf>is nothing but a wuss!
<string>And even though Ibushi is a scaredy-cat,<lf>I still count it as a victory! And my<lf>Lady breathed a sigh of relief as well!
<string>You should be the one to pounce<lf>on Narwa once we know where<lf>it's hiding.
<string>After all, you were the one who chased<lf>away Ibushi! There's no one more suited<lf>fur the glory of defeating Narwa.
<string>I was su-purr touched by Elder Fugen's<lf>speech. It was great!
<string>The solidarity of the villagers!<lf>The unwavering trust they have fur you!
<string>Narwa shall be a difficult hunt, but<lf>between your effurts and Kamew-ra's amity,<lf>there's no way you'll lose! Good luck!
<string>Mew...<lf>We came to Kamew-ra as traders,<lf>but after witnessing the Rampage...
<string>I now understand how important home is.<lf>I feel a little homesick, actually.
<string>You know, you're known as a hero<lf>in our homeland, as the Hunter who<lf>saved their village from a calamity.
<string>And Lady Rondine holds you in<lf>high esteem. You might even gain<lf>an audience with her Majesty!
<string>But if that happens, we'll have<lf>to give you a crash course<lf>on our table etiquette.
<string>It's time fur the final showdown, then?<lf>Well, have no fur—I mean fear!
<string>Your opponents are both cowards who've<lf>fled from you once before; I can think of<lf>no reason this time should be any different.
<string>Well, except that their rendezvous threatens<lf>to be awash with all sorts of unknown<lf>perils... So just be careful meow.
<string>You brought the Rampage to an end!<lf>I must say, your skills might just rival<lf>even our dear Lady Rondine's.
<string>Her Majesty the Queen is aware of your<lf>name now. Best purr-actice your manners<lf>in case you're invited to court.
<string>Hunter. Do you know what that<lf>machine in the Plaza is? You<lf>know, the big, green one.
<string>Why do I ask? Well...<lf>It's uh...a little scary.
<string>Meow, I'm no scaredy-cat...<lf>b-but that thing is terrifying.
<string>I never thought I would discover<lf>a mew source of fear, let alone<lf>here of all places...
<string>Lady Rondine got purr-etty upset with<lf>me again because I messed up some goods...
<string>But, I just can't take my eyes off of<lf>that green machine in the middle of<lf>the Plaza...
<string>I can't get over how scary it looks...<lf>And when I try to work without looking<lf>in that direction, I screw something up.
<string>Yet the Buddies here in Kamew-ra<lf>use it to train day after day.
<string>...<lf>I need to step up my game.
<string>Th-That Toadversary...<lf>I'm still terrified of its appearance,<lf>but I must—no, I WILL—get over it.
<string>I went up against the Toadversary<lf>yesterday evening trying to overcome<lf>my fear...
<string>But before I knew it, I woke up on<lf>Lady Rondine's lap... I had lost<lf>consciousness mid-fight.
<string>Both the Lady and Chino say I shouldn't<lf>overdo it, but...I cannot go home without<lf>conquering that...that thing!
<string>Iori and Kogarashi helped me climb up<lf>into the Toadversary's cockpit.
<string>And lo and behold, all of that fear<lf>disappeared and I suddenly felt fine.
<string>It's strange. As soon as I realized that<lf>I could control it, I now see it fur<lf>the machine that it is.

<string>...That Toadversary thingy still scares the<lf>be-Jaggis out of me! When I was training,<lf>it suddenly did something diffur-ent.
<string>It came down right in fur-ont of me,<lf>and I...I passed out fur-om fear.
<string>I never knew that machine could do<lf>such a thing. Meow I'm not sure if<lf>I'll ever be able to face it again...
