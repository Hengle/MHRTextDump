<string>Been waitin' for ya!
<string>So, <PL>, how's hunts with<lf>Palamutes been going? I've got a couple<lf>of things you can use out on your hunts!
<string>First, a handy dandy <COLS RED>Palamute Pouch</COL>.<lf>And then a new command: <COL RED>Sniff 'em out!</COL>!<lf>Both super useful for gathering.
<string>When you're out on a quest and can't carry<lf>any more items, <COLS RED>you can use the Palamute<lf>Pouch to carry extra items</COL>!
<string><NOTE:413>You don't have to equip it like other<lf>Palamute Gear. Just take your Palamute<lf>with you on the quest, and that's it!
<string><NOTE:414>And, the "Sniff 'em out!" command is even<lf>better. Using it will <COLS RED>point out various items<lf>and endemic life on the map</COL>!
<string>Now your Palamutes are even more useful<lf>than ever! Please make good use of 'em!
<string>I'd love to hear what you think the next<lf>time you're in town! Until then, enjoy!
<string>Heading over to the Kingdom's outpost,<lf>are ya? Goka girl and I've heard that they<lf>have Royal Palamutes there!
<string>Isn't that something? Well, we have Iori's<lf>parents to thank for that.
<string>The next time you're around, Goka and<lf>I are eager to hear about Canynes in<lf>the Kingdom.
<string>I don't suppose you've met the Felyne in<lf>charge of the Buddy Piazza over there<lf>yet, have you?
<string>Like my Goka girl here, he's not much<lf>of a fighter. His strengths lie in that<lf>clever brain of his.
<string>That's why we decided to send him to<lf>Elgado to work with the Buddies there.
<string>If anything happens over there, you let<lf>him know, OK? Then it'll get passed on<lf>to me!
<string>So how's hunting in unfamiliar territory?<lf>Get used to it yet?
<string>I must admit, I did worry about you and<lf>your Buddies being out there...
<string>But I'm so relieved to hear that you're<lf>doing well. Keep up the good work,<lf>and don't overdo it now, you hear?
<string>Heard some big baddies were invading<lf>from the Kingdom.
<string>No wonder my puppy-wuppy's been<lf>super fidgety...
<string>Sounds like a mess, but I'm sure it's<lf>nothing you can't handle. Just be<lf>careful out there, OK?
<string>Thanks to Iori's parents, Palamutes have<lf>become popular in the Kingdom.
<string>They still have a long journey ahead of them,<lf>but they've been making steady progress.
<string>And it definitely helps when people see<lf>a skilled hunter like you out hunting with<lf>a Palamute.
<string>The next time I send them a letter,<lf>I'll let them know that their hard work<lf>has been paying off.
<string>Whenever you come back into town my<lf>wittle Goka-girl's ears perk up and her<lf>tail starts wagging like crazy.
<string>Wish she was that excited to see me!<lf>Haha! But I can understand, she's<lf>always with me.
<string>And let's not kid ourselves, you're<lf>the village's big hero! Everyone's<lf>excited when you come into town.
<string>I don't know what it is, but you always<lf>bring this...energy with you. It's easy to<lf>see how people are drawn to it.
<string>If you haven't given it a try yet,<lf>just hold <MR PL_ACTION_DROP> when you're near<lf>your Palamute and hop on!
