<string><NOFAC>Ah, Meowster!<lf>A purr-leasure to be of service.
<string>I have been sent from the Hunter's<lf>Guild to act as your purr-sonal<lf>Housekeeper.
<string>A Housekeeper is someone who takes care<lf>of tasks so that a hunter may prepare<lf>for their hunt in comfur-t and style.
<string>If you require something to be done<lf>in your stead, I'll be happy to take<lf>on a range of tasks.
<string>I shall do my very best to wait on you<lf>paw and...uh, paw!
<string>If you need any tasks done, please<lf>feel fur-ee to send them my way!<lf>I'm always here at your service.
<string>Meowster!<lf>This is the beginning of your life as<lf>a furry—er...FULLY fur-ledged Hunter!
<string>But I can already tell you're<lf>a one-of-a-kind hunter who'll<lf>reach the heights of hunting!
<string>It is an absolute honor to be able<lf>to serve such unpurr-ecedented talent!
<string>Meowster, I hear you're off to take<lf>on the Rampage.
<string>A litter of meownsters is nothing to fear<lf>furr Kamura's future greatest hunter.
<string>I envision your glorious triumph already.<lf>Meow all you have to do is make it happen!
<string>I heard you encountered Magnameowlo,<lf>Meowster!
<string>Magnameowlo is indeed a worthy adversary.
<string>Hunting it shall be a big leap<lf>forward to eternal glory! Good<lf>luck to you, Meowster!
<string>OK, Meowster! This is it.<lf>This is where you end it<lf>with Magnameowlo.
<string>Show that meownster the unparalleled<lf>strength that only Kamura's future<lf>greatest hunter can muster!
<string>A magnificent Magnameowlo hunt that was,<lf>Meowster!
<string>I expected nothing less from the future<lf>paw-ragon of hunters!
<string>I am truly humbled to be of service<lf>to such an incredible individual!<lf>I bow my whiskers to you!
<string>I find myself ceaselessly marveled<lf>each time I hear about your hunting<lf>exploits, Meowster.
<string>The day you reach the top is most<lf>definitely appurroaching! You certainly<lf>look the part already!
<string>Your brow is furrowed. Are you<lf>nervous about the Apex hunt, Meowster?
<string>There is nothing to worry about,<lf>as no calamity bears fearing<lf>when you're around.
<string>This situation with Miss Hinoa must<lf>be a trial, navigating it a test of your<lf>hunter's resolve.
<string>To do so, you must hunt the blue dragon.<lf>It is a challenge that I believe you are<lf>purr-fectly capable of accomplishing.
<string>So, the time has come for you<lf>to hunt Wind Serpent Ibushi!
<string>This is a pawsitively crucial step in<lf>rising to the top of hunting history!<lf>I'll be wishing for your success!
<string>Meowster, I heard you've defeated Ibushi!
<string>Pawsitively marvelous! THAT is exactly<lf>the display one would expect fur-om<lf>Kamura's future greatest hunter!
<string>It seems that Thunder Serpent Narwa<lf>is the root cause of the Rampage.
<string>Meowster, there is no one more fitting<lf>to take on Narwa but the hunter who<lf>defeated the Thunder Serpent!
<string>You must not allow another to get<lf>their paws on this glory!
<string>Meowster, it is time to hunt<lf>the Thunder Serpent!
<string>And when you defeat it, you shall go<lf>down in the annals of hunting history<lf>as the greatest hunter who ever lived!
<string>I believe in you, Meowster!<lf>And I shall be here waiting,<lf>wishing fur your safe return!
<string>Pawsitively incredible, Meowster!<lf>You truly defeated Narwa!
<string>Tremeowndous! Astounding! Monumeowntal!<lf>I expected nothing less fur-om the future<lf>champion of the hunters!
<string>And truly, I am nothing less than<lf>thrilled to be in your service!
<string>The Rampage still rampages, and more<lf>powerful meownsters are appearing<lf>everywhere. A dangerous time, indeed...
<string>But a wealth of oppurrtunity, too!<lf>It means that you now have many<lf>more avenues to achieving glory!
<string>You are the hunter destined for<lf>greatest-of-all-time-status, after all.<lf>You've many more legends in the making!
<string>This is it, Meowster!<lf>Your greatest moment of glory!
<string>The two meownsters may have met,<lf>but have no fear, as you've already<lf>defeated them once before!
<string>I shall await your safe return, Meowster!<lf>Please, do take care!
<string>Meeting you has been a most incredible<lf>turn of fate fur me, Meowster.
<string>It is a true fur-licity to serve the hero<lf>responsible for ending the Rampage!
<string>So much so that the tips of my whiskers<lf>are tingling! I cannot thank you enough!
<string>What can this humble cat-tendant<lf>do fur you today, Meowster?
<string>It is an absolute honor to be able to serve<lf>such prodigious talent—especially one as<lf>unpurr-aralleled as the Savior of Kamura...!
<string>So purr-lease, do call on me fur anything<lf>you might need, without hesitation!
<string>What an exquisitely serene landscape.<lf>Kamura Village is truly magnificent.
<string>Being raised here must be the reason why<lf>your heart is great as a meowntain, vast<lf>as the skies, and clear as the water.
<string>Whenever I gaze upon the steel bellows,<lf>I feel so very fiery to the core.
<string>Being raised near such hardy flame must<lf>be the reason for your stalwart heart,<lf>unwavering in the face of difficulty!
<string>Both Elder Fugen and Master Hojo<lf>are such wonderful leaders.
<string>They have a natural authority that<lf>inspires confidence in their vassals.
<string>Seeing their leadership must have<lf>rubbed off on you, and that's why<lf>you get along so well with everyone.
<string>Miss Hinoa and Miss Minoto are both<lf>beautiful, caring, and yet no less<lf>resolute for it.
<string>Having furriends such as them must<lf>be the root of your incredible<lf>generosity and courage.
<string>The people of Kamura Village<lf>overcome every trial they face<lf>with a steel-like solidarity.
<string>Growing up in such a close-knit<lf>commew-nity must be why you<lf>are always so compassionate.
<string>The Bunny Dango of Kamura Village<lf>are not just tasty and filling, but full of<lf>mewtritional value, too.
<string>Eating such mewtritious food from a<lf>young age must be why you have both<lf>a sharp mind and a robust body.
