<string>You make sure to eat some<lf>Bunny Dango before you came?
<string>Well, if you forgot anything,<lf>make sure to head to the tent!
<string>Let's see how far you've come!<lf>Show me what you got!
<string>And don't worry, I'll be there<lf>to help out just in case.
<string>This is gonna be one for<lf>the ages, Ace! I'm feelin' it!
<string>I can take on anything<lf>thrown at me!
<string>It's time for two of Kamura's<lf>gnarliest to finally hunt together!
<string>OK, let's see if you remember<lf>everything I taught you!
<string>So, I hear you already took down<lf>a Lunagaron, huh?
<string>Didn't expect any less of you!<lf>You're a quick learner!
<string>With you by my side, we don't<lf>have to worry about anything!
<string>You've really become<lf>somethin' special, Ace!
<string>Actually, maybe I'll save the<lf>praise until we finish up, eh?
<string>Not even from the village, but<lf>giving props to Ace! Gnarly!
<string>And as <PL>'s teacher,<lf>I won't be slackin' off.
<string>So, Arlow. How's our Ace doin'?
<string>That bad, huh? I-It's OK! Even<lf>the best disciples have off days!
<string>Mostly hanging out with my gnarly<lf>new friend, Pasapato!
<string>Other than that, checking in on Ace<lf>to see how things are going!
<string>Sup, Ace! For this quest,<lf>you'll have two instructors!
<string>For each question you'll get two<lf>answers! Now that's value for zenny!
<string>Ha! No way! We gotta work together to<lf>lead Ace here to even greater heights!
<string>That's the spirit, Jae! I look<lf>forward to seeing you in action!
<string>Alright, Ace! Let's show Jae<lf>what Kamura hunters can do!
<string>So, Jae! Did Master Arlow teach<lf>you any gnarly skills?
<string>Whoa! That IS pretty gnarly!
<string>Hmmm... We mostly use the<lf>Toadversary to thrash on!
<string>Ace and I are ready and raring to go!
<string>You heard that, Ace!<lf>It's time to thrash!
<string>I could use a good workout, I haven't<lf>been hunting much lately...
<string>Well, thanks to Ace, it is.<lf>Wait, shouldn't you be watching it?
<string>Sup, Ace! Elder Fugen will be<lf>accompanying us on this fine day.
<string>Let's use this opportunity to learn<lf>as much as we can from him!
<string>Sup, Ace! So, Minoto wants to<lf>up her defender skills, huh?
<string>Minoto, you could have<lf>just asked me!
<string>I have all kinds of gnarly routines<lf>to get you in tip-top shape!
<string>Whoa, Minoto! You're a natural!<lf>I think this calls for more training!
<string>No, definitely not! Someday you'll be<lf>the greatest hunter who's ever lived!
<string>But I think it's time to unlock your<lf>true potential as a hunter, Minoto!
<string>All you need is more training!<lf>Right, Ace? Let's thrash!
