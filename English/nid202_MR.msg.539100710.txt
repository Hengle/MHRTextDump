<string>I met Meowster Hamon's new apurr-entice<lf>from the Kingdom earlier.
<string>She was meowvelous. Picked up on<lf>Meowster Hamon's techniques almost<lf>instantly. She was really something!
<string>Still, watching her, I wondered if<lf>teaching her our secrets was<lf>actually good for Kamura.
<string>Nakago felt that spreading Master's<lf>teachings would inspire mew smithies<lf>to make even better techniques.
<string>Talk about hitting the nail on the head!<lf>Instead of focusing on the village, we<lf>should consider the future of forging.
<string>I was too short-sighted. Just you wait,<lf>I'll dig in and cook up some techniques<lf>that'll knock the Kingdom's socks off!
<string>You ever made rice balls before?<lf>While Seihaku is the best in the village,<lf>I can make a mean rice ball myself.
<string>You gotta pack it firmly. Not too loose<lf>otherwise it'll just fall apart, And not<lf>too tight, it's not like making a snowball.
<string>Oh, and leave some bite in the rice when<lf>you cook it. A nice, long boil's crucial<lf>for an exquisite rice ball.
<string>But more than anything, you gotta have<lf>good ingredients to make good food.<lf>Tasty rice makes for a tasty rice ball!
<string>And if we're talking tasty rice, we're<lf>talking Senari's rice. Guaranteed to<lf>make any meow-th water!
<string>The past couple days, Nakago's been<lf>working on something he calls,<lf>"Mr. Rice Vice."
<string>It's an appur-atus that supposedly makes<lf>rice balls... But you can't really call what<lf>comes out of it a rice ball...
<string>I mean, rice in a ball shape comes out,<lf>but... I don't know. It's missing that<lf>one crucial ingredient. "Love."
<string>I can't find any fault with the actual idea<lf>or execution. But concept-wise... Just<lf>doesn't sit right with me, mew'know?
<string>Hinami's always asking me what<lf>I'm having fur dinner.
<string>She claims she's not a good cook, but<lf>I don't think that's the case at all.
<string>I've seen what she makes her brother.<lf>It looks purr-etty good to me. Full of<lf>mew-trition and lovingly purr-pared.
<string>Her brother's not too bad either. It's funny,<lf>they're always fighting but at the same time,<lf>they're always taking care of each other.
<string>Maybe I should ask them what they're<lf>having fur dinner tonight?
<string>Nakago's a meticulous fella. I mentioned<lf>we should clean the floors, and the man's<lf>been on his paws and knees since morning.
<string>Every nook and cranny's shined to<lf>such a paw-lish, you can see your<lf>reflection in it!
<string>Unfur-tunately, he did such a good job<lf>that now it's really slippery! I almost<lf>busted my Astalos earlier...
<string>He felt so bad about it, that he's started<lf>looking for some rugs to put down. I hope<lf>he finds something nice and soft.
<string>Well, look who's back! Meow's it going<lf>over in the Kingdom?
<string>You getting enough to eat over there?<lf>I hope they're feeding you right.<lf>Speaking of...
<string>How about you come over to our place<lf>later and have dinner? Our treat!
<string>Meow, meow. Don't be shy. It's not trouble<lf>at all! Really! A meal fur three is hardly<lf>more work than a meal fur two!
