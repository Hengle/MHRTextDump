<string>Up here, Hunter!
<string>Let me cut right to the chase. Are you<lf>taking care of your Palicoes? You're not<lf>letting them go feral?
<string>Nagi at the Buddy Piazza actually said<lf>there's a special Bombardier upgrade<lf>campaign going on right now.
<string>Just complete three master rank quests<lf>with a Bombardier-type Palico and they'll<lf>get access to a new type of Support Move.
<string>You and your Palicoes still have plenty<lf>of room for growth. I can't wait to see<lf>the heights you'll reach together!
<string>I'm so happy for you!
<string>Yay! Congratulations on completing the<lf>promotion! Your Palicoes should have<lf>learned a new Secret Support Move.
<string>Something with fireworks? Sounds like<lf>the perfect way to celebrate completing<lf>the promotion and learning something new.
<string>I'm happy I asked you to push yourself.<lf>Please continue to train them with a<lf>firm yet gentle hand!
<string>It is a pleasure to meet you, Hunter.<lf>Sue is the name, and managing equipment<lf>for the research team is my game.
<string>Unfortunately, managing Gatlyn is my job,<lf>too... She's still getting used to her work,<lf>but she's got a pretty good sense for it.
<string>Now if I could just get her mind out of<lf>the clouds and her nose out of that<lf>notebook, my life would be a lot easier!
<string>The more I see Gatlyn work, the more<lf>I see what she needs to improve.
<string>She needs ambition. You gotta have massive<lf>amounts of it to investigate a massive crater.
<string>She still has a long way to go on the path<lf>to becoming a key member of the team.<lf>I really envy how carefree she is...
<string>As a trainer for newbies, you want to<lf>commend and give positive feedback<lf>to those you're training...
<string>But, it's hard to praise someone when<lf>they spend all day taking notes and don't<lf>remember half the stuff they write down!
<string>So Gatlyn is distracted again huh?<lf>You see what I was talking about now,<lf>Hunter?
<string>She's pretending to work, but what she's<lf>actually doing is ranking the popularity<lf>of Elgado's Bunny Dango.
<string>This is nothing new... The last time I<lf>checked, she was keeping a journal<lf>of knights on special assignments.
<string>I think Gatlyn could achieve a lot more<lf>if she worked as hard as Lady Fiorayne.
<string>It might even make my job a little easier.<lf>But how long will it take for her to realize<lf>this...
<string>All the knights and hunters seem<lf>to be in high spirits.
<string>I'm going to show Gatlyn the resolve and<lf>attitude of the research team!
<string>I'm so relieved that Bahari is doing OK.<lf>He is a top-notch scientist after all.
<string>He has ideas and skills that are essential<lf>not only for maintaining Elgado's facilities,<lf>but also for making them better!
<string>It's rare for Gatlyn to offer good ideas.<lf>But she's right. Our technology can<lf>be used to help people!
<string>She's definitely settling in. Whichever<lf>clever kitty is teaching her the ropes,<lf>think it's working! Who could it be?
<string>My paws have been full with refitting<lf>repairs recently. Even as I stand here<lf>talking the paperwork is piling up.
<string>Sorting and ordering materials, updating<lf>the schedule and work roster, checking<lf>facilities! I'm not busy, I'm swamped!
<string>Just where has Rowan snuck off to?<lf>Hunter, if you see one of the crew<lf>fishing all day, can you drag him to me?
<string>We brought almost all the tools we use<lf>here in Elgado from the Kingdom.
<string>But if you need something we don't have<lf>or something made-to-order, you can<lf>ask our Smithy, Minayle!
<string>Just sketch out what you need and she'll<lf>bang it out in a jiffy! We can't go wrong<lf>with her on our side!
<string>Gatlyn's mind still wanders when I'm<lf>explaining things. Sometimes I need to<lf>steel my whiskers and crack the whip.
<string>But I'm not very good at expressing<lf>authority. So what's the best approach?<lf>An air of Felyne menace?
<string>Hisss! Meeeow—Nope, not very convincing...<lf>Acting against type is just so exhausting.
<string>What's gotten into her? I've never seen<lf>Gatlyn so serious!
<string>Have things finally clicked for her?<lf>Is she a true member of the team? Maybe<lf>my work ethic has rubbed off at last!
<string>I'm really worried about Lady Fiorayne.<lf>Aren't you?
<string>I'd love to go see her, but a visit from<lf>my worrying whiskers isn't likely to<lf>cheer her up.
<string>Nope. I know my role! To get this place<lf>ship-shape for when she's finally back<lf>on her feet!
<string>I'm overflowing with gratitude for the<lf>doc who fixed up that medicine! Good<lf>news about Fiorayne at last!
<string>I want to express some gratitude in<lf>a practical way. Build a new facility?<lf>Or send a gift basket of Bunny Dango?
<string>I hope this means the Kingdom monsters<lf>are going to calm down a little.
<string>That will reduce the time spent worrying<lf>about keeping Elgado safe, and let us<lf>turn our paws to other tasks.
<string>The knights of the Order still seem so<lf>tense. Malzeno is gone! Can't we all<lf>relax a little?
<string>Is there still a problem that needs to<lf>be resolved? Or is research into that<lf>also ongoing?
<string>Hunter, dear Hunter. Are you serious?<lf>You're going back into that dreadful<lf>place?
<string>I respect all you do for us. I know what<lf>I have to do! Whip Gatlyn's tail into shape,<lf>double time!
<string>Everyone is so busy, getting ready to<lf>fight that elder dragon. But something<lf>else has grabbed my attention.
<string>When I saw Gatlyn, working hard to get<lf>that massive ship ready! Well, tears wet<lf>my whiskers, I'll put it like that!
<string>It's silly, I know, carrying on like this<lf>at such a crucial time. But I'm so<lf>happy to see her growth, I could purr!
<string>I know Gatlyn's hard work will pay off.<lf>That ship could ride a tidal wave into<lf>the harbor and just anchor on the dock!
<string>We're out of danger in these parts, dear<lf>Hunter, and it's all thanks to you.<lf>So let me say it again—thank you!
<string>Now I can get back to the real fight—<lf>improving our facilities! I hope Gatlyn<lf>shows a little more enthusiasm too!
<string>Her finishes are still a little uneven.<lf>My paws must continue to guide her!
<string>I took on the role of training our new<lf>recruit! My whiskers are my word!<lf>I will not back down now!
<string>I have to see this to the end! No matter<lf>how soul crushing it may seem! The<lf>fight continues!
<string>Tell me, Hunter, how do you find life in<lf>Elgado? Pretty comfy here, isn't it?
<string>We've tagged a lot of stuff on, so it's<lf>a bit of a patchwork—but that also means<lf>everything's conveniently close by!
<string>Gatlyn has good instincts, but she can't<lf>nail the finishing touches. One reason<lf>is she relies too much on her senses.
<string>All she needs is more knowledge to back<lf>up that talent. Then she's got a bright<lf>future fixing things ahead of her!
<string>A little respect for the one educating<lf>her also wouldn't go amiss, bless my<lf>whiskers.
<string>One of our most important tasks is to<lf>listen to everyone's requests, and then<lf>reflect them in our improvements.
<string>Gatlyn is very friendly, so she's great<lf>at that side of things. Everyone in<lf>Elgado loves to chat with her.
<string>So much has happened! I need to take<lf>a break and treat Gatlyn to some dango<lf>before I start stress shedding.
<string>The issue is, when she knows I'm paying<lf>she doesn't hold back. Or maybe she<lf>just thinks it's all you can eat?
<string>My Felyne facility instincts tell me<lf>Elgado will continue to expand. You can<lf>never have too many new buildings!
<string>That means we'll need to bring in more<lf>staff. And so the cycle of never-ending<lf>work...never ends!
<string>I'm just going to be run off my paws,<lf>turning this place into the best base<lf>you've ever seen!
<string>Meow! Bam! Meow! Bam!<lf>Meow BAM BAM!
<string>When I throw myself into my work, I<lf>completely forget the passage of time.
<string>You should give it a try, Hunter.<lf>All the noise in your head fades away—<lf>like you might reach enlightenment.
<string>Meow! Bam! Meow! Bam!<lf>Meow BAM BAM!
<string>Hmmm. I've got a problem.
<string>Hello, Hunter. I've got something I need<lf>to discuss with you, if you have a<lf>moment?
<string>Master Supy is getting all worked up about<lf>finding something rare, but I'm worried that<lf>it's cursed Buddy Equipment!
<string>I've been asking around, and the<lf>consensus is we need to perform a<lf>purification. Could you help out?
<string>Can you collect the materials we need to<lf>create the tools for the task? I want to<lf>finish this purification quickly!
<string>I should've seen this coming!
<string>We prepared the tools, thanks to you,<lf>but in the end the purification is off.
<string>Master Supy decided he didn't want to<lf>risk damaging such a valuable piece with<lf>any kind of ritual.
<string>In fact, he even went ahead and worked<lf>out a way to upgrade the gear! Head to<lf>the Buddy Smithy and take a look.
<string>I have something to discuss.
<string>Are you putting your Palicoes to work,<lf>Hunter? I have some information that<lf>might be of great benefit to you.
<string>The Kingdom is currently hard at work<lf>on an official set of Palico equipment!<lf>It's really going to ruffle some fur!
<string>But it's also only going to be available<lf>to those who deliver a special treasure<lf>from the Citadel.
<string>Think of this as a wonderful present you<lf>can give to your hardworking Palicoes!<lf>Head out and bag that treasure!
<string>Thank you so much!
<string>Most impressive, Hunter! Delivering that<lf>treasure means you now have permission<lf>to make the special gear!
<string>Head over to the Buddy Smithy and<lf>you'll find it ready and waiting. I'm<lf>sure your Palicoes will be thrilled!
<string>I hope you'll continue to use a firm but<lf>fair hand with your Palicoes in the<lf>future. Easier said than done, I know!
