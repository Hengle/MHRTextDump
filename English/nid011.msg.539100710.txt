<string>Hey, <PL>. Looks like things<lf>are about to get real busy with the Rampage<lf>right around the corner, huh?
<string>...Oh, wait—Are ya shopping<lf>with Hinoa? Well, in that case,<lf>we can talk later.
<string>This is my Canyne, Goka. She's a real sweet,<lf>easygoing gal, yes she is. Hunting's not really<lf>her thing so she hangs out here with me.
<string>Sure, she might not get to experience the thrill<lf>of being a Buddy, but that's OK. She's my<lf>wittle puppy-wuppy, that keeps me company.
<string>Besides, it's not like there's some<lf>rule that says all Canynes have to<lf>go out on hunts.
<string>If one path isn't right for you, there'll<lf>always be another better suited to<lf>you that you can take.
<string>I guess Goka's path wasn't to be a Buddy,<lf>but someone who's by my side when I need<lf>her most... And that's fine by both of us.
<string>Hey, <PL>. I hear you've<lf>made hunter. That's great timing,<lf>you know, with the Rampage and all.
<string>Too bad, I'm not very handy with<lf>a weapon. I can't protect the village<lf>the same way you can.
<string>But the Canynes I've trained can<lf>take up arms and go out there with<lf>you, brave as can be, in my stead.
<string>If you're interested in hiring more<lf>Canynes as Buddies, go talk to<lf>Iori in the Buddy Plaza.
<string>This is my Canyne, Goka. She's a real sweet,<lf>easygoing gal, yes she is. Hunting's not really<lf>her thing so she hangs out here with me.

<string>Heya, <PL>, are you thinking<lf>about helping Iori over in the<lf>Buddy Plaza, by any chance?
<string>That boy's like a son to me, so I'm always<lf>looking out for him. Especially since his<lf>parents are close friends of mine.
<string>We spent a lot of time together raising<lf>and training Palamutes, they're just as<lf>much family to me as my wittle, Goka!
<string>They've been out of town for a while now.<lf>Going from town to town, training hunters<lf>to use Canynes as Palamutes.
<string>I promised 'em I'd make sure he was<lf>alright while they were gone.
<string>And since Hamon's worried about him<lf>too, we'd both be grateful if you could<lf>lend Iori a hand whenever he needs it.
<string>Seeing the son of my good friends<lf>struggle was like watching my own<lf>child struggle.
<string>I can't thank you enough for giving him<lf>the help he needed to put things right.<lf>And my wittle Goka girl thanks you too!
<string>You're becoming a wonderful hunter,<lf>ya know? And right before our eyes too.<lf>We're all so glad to be able to see it.
<string>Iori will be going to the Stronghold<lf>to help out as a defender, so I'm told.
<string>As shameful as it is, I'm not cut out for<lf>any kind of fighting. Even if I tried my<lf>best, I'd only slow everyone else down.
<string>So instead, I'm going to stay here with<lf>my Goka girl and look after the Buddy<lf>Plaza while Iori is gone.
<string>The Buddies and I'll be praying that you<lf>all make it back in one piece.
<string>I heard you, Iori, and Yomogi were<lf>attacked by Magnamalo. Me and Goka<lf>were worried sick, isn't that right Goka girl!?
<string>Magnamalo has been Master Hamon's<lf>nemesis ever since the calamity fifty<lf>years ago.
<string>And with that attack on Iori,<lf>I'm sure that bitter grudge<lf>has only gotten worse.
<string>Hamon, for all his silent appearances, is<lf>a man of passion. I'll bet you anything<lf>he's boiling with anger on the inside.
<string>Master Hamon has been an inspiration<lf>for many of us villagers. Especially ones<lf>that are not cut out to be fighters.
<string>Seeing him transition from a hunter to<lf>a smithy gave a lot of us a sense of real<lf>purpose. We all don't need to be hunters...
<string>Everyone can protect Kamura by doing<lf>their part. Iori's parents and I found our<lf>calling training Palamutes.
<string>With this "device" of his, Master Hamon's<lf>once again showing us how we can all<lf>help fight the Rampage in our own way.
<string>I'm sure that, in due time, Yomogi and<lf>Iori will come to understand Elder Fugen's<lf>teachings. Isn't that right, Goka!?
<string>Hello, <PL>.<lf>I hear you're going up against<lf>Magnamalo.
<string>Master Hamon probably regrets<lf>not being able to stop the Rampage<lf>fifty years ago...
<string>That's why he worked so hard<lf>on his device—to help you<lf>finish the job.
<string>If Iori's parents were here, I'm sure<lf>they'd have asked you to help Hamon.<lf>So I'll ask you in their stead...
<string>Please, defeat Magnamalo. For Master<lf>Hamon, for the children, for the future<lf>of Kamura! ...And for my Goka.
<string>I'm no warrior, I'd make a lousy defender.<lf>But by raising and training Palamutes,<lf>I can contribute to the fight.
<string>If you want to work well as a team,<lf>you have to accept and draw on each<lf>other's strengths. Ego is the enemy!
<string>Elder Fugen, knowing how crucial<lf>that is, gave Yomogi and Iori<lf>the opportunity to learn that too.
<string>And now, thanks to Master Hamon,<lf>it looks like they finally have.
<string>I wonder where Iori's folks are now...<lf>I'm sure they'd be proud to hear it.
<string>It appears Iori's encounter with<lf>Magnamalo has matured him.<lf>Maybe even Master Hamon. Hahaha!
<string>I hope Iori's parents are doing well.<lf>Wherever they are...I know they're<lf>working hard.
<string>I can't wait to see the look on their<lf>faces when they come home and see<lf>Iori and his grandfather getting along again.
<string>Did you hear that, Goka? Our hunter friend<lf>here has started taking on Hub quests.<lf>Have you tried hunting in a group yet?
<string>You're sure to see lots of other<lf>hunters with their Palamutes!
<string>If you do, it's a good chance to see<lf>how others use Palamutes for hunting.<lf>Isn't that right, Goka!? Hehehe.

<string>If you do, it's a good chance to see<lf>how others use Palamutes for hunting.<lf>Isn't that right, Goka!? Hehehe.
<string>Goka's been real jittery lately.<lf>Which is strange because she's<lf>usually so calm.
<string>Might be a sign of things to come.<lf>Watch yourself out there, <PL>.
<string>The Rampage is close, is it? That<lf>may be why Goka is so fidgety... Don't<lf>you worry, Goka girl, I'm right here.
<string>You be extra careful, now. I hear there's<lf>an Apex leading the bunch this time.<lf>That's definitely gonna complicate things.
<string>Me and Goka are glad Hinoa's feeling<lf>better, but with that blue dragon still<lf>around, Goka's all jittery again.
<string>Speaking of Hinoa... I've always thought<lf>that her "gift" was remarkable. But I had<lf>no idea that it included monsters!

<string>Speaking of Hinoa... I've always thought<lf>that her "gift" was remarkable. But I had<lf>no idea that it included monsters!
<string>Wind Serpent... A fitting name for such<lf>a frightening monster. Just saying it<lf>makes my wittle Goka all fidgety.
<string>If it's behind the Rampage... Well...<lf>We all know what must be done.
<string>I'm sorry, <PL>...<lf>Sorry that we must call on you.<lf>But we're all counting on you!
<string>Time for you to take on<lf>Wind Serpent Ibushi?
<string>Goka says she hopes your Buddies<lf>are prepped and ready. Good luck to<lf>you and your brave little com-paw-dres!
<string>Way to go, <PL>!<lf>Ibushi has been repelled!<lf>But as great as that is...
<string>...my poor little Goka girl is still uneasy.<lf>With Ibushi gone, I thought the Rampage<lf>would calm down. What's going on?
<string>So that's why Goka was so spooked...<lf>First a Wind Serpent and NOW<lf>a Thunder Serpent?
<string>And I hear it's even more powerful than Ibushi.<lf>And if it's scary enough to drive those creepy-<lf>crawly Rakna-Kadaki out of the caverns...
<string>...then you know it's serious! Isn't that<lf>right, my wittle Goka girl? Be careful<lf>out there, <PL>.
<string>Narwa is a frighteningly powerful<lf>monster. But there is no one more<lf>suited to hunt it than you.
<string>As strange as it sounds, I'm pretty calm<lf>right now. I guess I just can't imagine you<lf>failing. At least...I don't want to imagine it.
<string>In these dark days of the Rampage,<lf>I see a light at the end of the tunnel.<lf>And that light is you. Good luck.
<string>Narwa and Ibushi...<lf>Should have known better than to think<lf>ending the Rampage would be easy.
<string>They're just as desperate to survive<lf>as we are. I suppose it's just a matter<lf>of who can put an end to who first.

<string>They're just as desperate to survive<lf>as we are. I suppose it's just a matter<lf>of who can put an end to who first.
<string>Off to bring Narwa and Ibushi<lf>their day of retribution?
<string>It won't be easy, but... You've already<lf>come this far, through peril after peril.<lf>Goka and I know you can does this!
<string>Isn't that right, Goka? We just ask<lf>that you come out the other side<lf>of this mess, OK...
<string>News is spreading about the brave Buddies<lf>that fought alongside the Hero of Kamura.<lf>The hero who ended the Rampage!
<string>Demand to learn about training<lf>Canynes is increasing and I must<lf>say, I can't complain!
<string>And this all thanks to your help!
<string>Hey, <PL>.<lf>Palamutes make getting around<lf>pretty easy, don't they?
<string>If you haven't given it a try yet,<lf>just hold <ICON PAD_A> when you're near<lf>your Palamute and hop on!
<string>It's the way to go when you gotta cover<lf>a lot of ground in a short amount of time.<lf>I highly recommend it!
<string>There are many differences between<lf>Palamutes and Palicoes, but in general,<lf>Palamutes fight, Palicoes assist. Simple.
<string>They both have their strengths and weaknesses.<lf>It's up to you how you use them during a hunt,<lf>but I'm sure you'll find them mighty useful!
<string>The concept of a Palamute began<lf>right here, in Kamura Village. Isn't<lf>that right, my Goka girl?
<string>I've never seen Canynes who can work<lf>with, fight for, and cart around hunters<lf>anywhere else. But that's changing!
<string>Iori's folks have been out spreading<lf>the good word! Well, that was until<lf>the Rampage came along...
<string>But if you make a name for yourself<lf>with a Palamute in tow, it'll do wonders<lf>for us, not to mention Kamura!
<string>Palamutes attack in sync with their hunter.
<string>They take their cue as the hunter readies<lf>their weapon, then move with their hunter's<lf>attack for extra damage.
<string>Use the offensive capabilities to your<lf>advantage and you're guaranteed<lf>success out in the field!
<string>Hey there, <PL>! Have you put<lf>a lot of thought into your Palamute's Gear?
<string>I hope so because each piece<lf>has the potential to vastly alter<lf>how your Palamute attacks.
<string>Keep in mind that choosing your<lf>Palamute's gear is just as essential<lf>as choosing your own!

<string>Keep in mind that choosing your<lf>Palamute's Gear is just as essential<lf>as choosing your own!
<string>Think you can<lf>lend me a hand?
<string>Hey, <PL>!<lf>I wanted to talk to you<lf>about an idea I had.
<string>I was thinking, how can I spread the word<lf>about Palamutes? And then it came to me:
<string>Why not put Canyne masks on Cohoots?<lf>That way, they'll be advertising Palamutes<lf>whenever and wherever they fly around.
<string>For example, you travel to a lot of<lf>different places; think you could<lf>put one on your Cohoot as well?
<string>If you bring me a picture of your Cohoot,<lf>I can eyeball it and make a mask without<lf>even needing to measure it.
<string>Thanks for your help.
<string>Got a picture of your Cohoot?<lf>Thank you, <PL>.<lf>May I take a look at it?
<string>Oh... Oh, OK.<lf>Yeah, this'll fit nicely.
<string>Here, take this Cohoot mask.<lf>And as a bonus, here's a<lf>matching outfit to go with it.
<string>With all the traveling you do,<lf>it's sure to help spread the word!<lf>Goka and I thank you!
<string>Think you can<lf>lend me a hand?
<string>Hi, <PL>.<lf>I was hoping you'd help me out<lf>with this little problem I have.
<string>I'm trying to develop some new Palamute<lf>Gear, but I, uh, accidently ran out of the<lf>materials I need to finish my prototype...
<string>I'm sorry to ask, but would it be<lf>possible for you to share some<lf>of the materials that you have?
<string>In return, I'll give you a special<lf>piece of Palamute Gear that I've<lf>already finished making.
<string>Not a bad deal, don't you think?<lf>Let me know if that sounds good<lf>to you.
<string>Thanks for your help.
<string>Thank you so much! Now I can<lf>continue making my prototype.<lf>Goka says thank you too!
<string>And here's the gear I promised.<lf>If you have any feedback,<lf>I'd be happy to hear it.
<string>I hope that tales of you and your<lf>geared-up Palamute's endeavors<lf>spread far and wide across the land.
<string>Think you can<lf>lend me a hand?
<string>Hey there, <PL>.<lf>Hard at work as always, I see.<lf>How's your Palamute treating you?
<string>Hearing stories about your work is such<lf>an inspiration. Every time I hear a story<lf>I get an idea for some new Palamute Gear.
<string>But then I got so excited and was in such a<lf>hurry to create that I forgot to get the materials<lf>I need... Do you have any you can spare?
<string>If so, I can set you up with some<lf>never-before-seen Palamute Gear<lf>when I'm finished.
<string>Thanks for your help.
<string>You're a life saver! Goka says thank<lf>you too! Now I can continue my work<lf>on this idea I have!
<string>And here's what I promised you.<lf>If you run into any problems<lf>with it, just let me know.
<string>Well then, I better get back to<lf>work while I'm still in the zone!
<string>Think you can<lf>lend me a hand?
<string>Hi, <PL>!<lf>Do you have some time on<lf>your hands? I need your help.
<string>Like I was saying before, hearing<lf>stories about your hunts really gets<lf>my creative juices flowing.
<string>And hearing your latest story got me thinking...<lf>What if I take a few Palamutes out and show<lf>hunters just how great they are?
<string>I'd likely run into monsters along the<lf>way, so I'll need to make some solid<lf>gear, but I don't have enough materials.
<string>Would you be willing to share some of the<lf>materials you have on hand? And just like<lf>always, I'll give you some Palamute Gear!
<string>Thank you for your help.
<string>Thank you so much! With this, I can<lf>craft some sturdy Palamute Gear<lf>and head out without any worries.
<string>Here, take this. I've tested it plenty<lf>of times. It should be OK, but let me<lf>know if you run into any issues.
<string>Now, how to go about the promotional<lf>side of things...? Well, I suppose I'll<lf>figure something out.
<string>Think you can<lf>lend me a hand?
<string>Hey, <PL>.<lf>Can I ask you something?
<string>I'm working on some Palamute Gear<lf>ideas. Stuff that should be a big help<lf>when you're out hunting!
<string>I've managed to complete one thing<lf>that I'm rather proud of, but I need<lf>someone to test it out for me.
<string>It's a little finicky, though, so I can<lf>only entrust it to someone able to<lf>properly train a Palamute.
<string>If you can train one of your<lf>Palamutes, I'd happily give<lf>it to you. What do you think?
<string>Thank you for your help.
<string>I heard from some of the folks<lf>at the Buddy Plaza that your<lf>Palamute training is going well.
<string>Here, have this. I know it'll be<lf>safe in the hands of someone<lf>with your level of experience.
<string>And let me know how it performs<lf>so I can improve my future pieces,<lf>OK?
<string>Think you can<lf>lend me a hand?
<string>Hey there, <PL>.<lf>How are hunts going with<lf>your Palamutes?
<string>If you're interested, I've made something<lf>a little experimental this time, and I'm<lf>looking for someone to try it out.
<string>It'd have to be someone experienced in<lf>Palamute training—besides me, of course.<lf>Somebody who can gain their trust...
<string>And I couldn't think of anyone<lf>better than you, isn't that right,<lf>Goka? Well, what do you say?
<string>Thank you for your help.
<string>Everyone's talking about how good<lf>you are with your Palamutes!<lf>Isn't that right, my wittle Goka?
<string>I knew you would be! I think<lf>I can trust you with this.<lf>Enjoy!
<string>And feedback from someone as deeply<lf>passionate about Palamutes as you is<lf>priceless; let me know what you think.
<string>Think you can<lf>lend me a hand?
<string>Hey, <PL>.<lf>How's hunting with Palamutes going?
<string>The Buddy Smithies were telling me that they<lf>really want to get better at making Palamute<lf>equipment, but they need more practice.
<string>If you order some gear from them, not only<lf>will you get some nice stuff, but you'll also<lf>be helping them out. And me as well!
<string>Once they've had enough practice,<lf>come talk to me, and I'll give you<lf>some Palamute Gear as thanks.
<string>Thank you for your help.
<string>Thanks for your help, <PL>.<lf>It's much appreciated.
<string>I'm sure they have the hang of making<lf>Palamute equipment now, which not<lf>only benefits them but everyone.
<string>And here's the Palamute Gear<lf>I promised. I know you'll go on<lf>to accomplish great things with it.
<string>Think you can<lf>lend me a hand?
<string>Hey, <PL>. How are things?<lf>How are your Palamutes<lf>doing?
<string>I was talking to the Buddy Smithies, and<lf>it looks like they're really obsessed with<lf>forging Palamute equipment now.
<string>They were so excited about learning and trying<lf>something new. No doubt that Master Hamon's<lf>enthusiasm has rubbed off on them.
<string>They keep nudging me every time I go over<lf>there. "Hey, does <PL><lf>need anything!?"
<string>Think you can help them out? And of course,<lf>you helping them, helps me. I'll even throw in<lf>a little reward for your trouble. How about it?
<string>Thank you for your help.
<string>Thanks, <PL>.<lf>The Buddy Smithies told me you<lf>ordered a whole bunch of stuff from them.
<string>They were grinning whisker to whisker too!<lf>They told me to tell you thanks for getting<lf>them into forging Palamute Gear.
<string>Also, here take this. A little something for<lf>your troubles. I hope that you and your<lf>Palamutes can put it to good use.
