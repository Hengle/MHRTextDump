<string>Do you got a meowment fur me?
<string>How are things with your Palicoes?<lf>Giving your Buddies purrlenty of fish?<lf>Sorry, not trying to be nosey...
<string>Anyway, I was just asking because Nagi<lf>tells me there's an assist upgrade campaign<lf>going on at the Buddy Piazza!
<string>All you gotta do is complete three master rank<lf>quests with an Assist-type Palico! Super easy,<lf>right? Like shooting fish in a barrel!
<string>I know you got bigger fish to fry, but why<lf>not help out your furry Felyne helpers!?
<string>Mew-Hoo! Congrats!
<string>You did it, Hunter! Now your Palicoes can<lf>equip a cool mew Secret Support Mew-ve!
<string>This paw-ticular one uses some kind of<lf>steam. It sounds kinda tasty! Think they<lf>can use it to steam some fish for me?
<string>How about steamed Jyuratodus? Anymew,<lf>I'm reel busy as you can see so get going<lf>be-fur you scare off all the fish!
<string>Can I talk to you fur a minute?
<string>I caught one, I tell you! I really caught one!<lf>I was just sittin' here, watching the waves<lf>when suddenly...
<string>I reeled one in! That long hair, those alluring<lf>eyes, that slippery tail! I caught a reel live<lf>mermaid! ...Buuuuuut then it got away.
<string>Now my fishing furr-iends'll never<lf>believe me... You gotta help meow-t,<lf>Hunter! You gotta catch one fur me!
<string>Purr-etty please! I can't look like a chump<lf>in front of my fishing chums!
<string>Mew-Hoo! You did it!
<string>Thanks for catching the mermaid, Hunter!<lf>Wha—!? It was a monster and NOT a mermaid?<lf>Well, now you're just splitting hairs!
<string>Oh, that reminds me! Your reward! I arranged<lf>for some meowty fine upgrades fur you over<lf>at the Smithy!
<string>They're definitely favorites of any lover of<lf>the lure! Go check 'em meow-t whenever<lf>you get the chance!
<string>Purrleasure to meet you, Hunter!
<string>What kind of fish can you catch out here?
<string>...<lf>......<lf>.........
<string>Well...<lf>I'm afraid I can't help you there,<lf>because I haven't caught any yet...
<string>Do you like sea fishing, Hunter? If you<lf>haven't tried it yet, I recommend it.
<string>The feeling of dropping your line into<lf>the endless abyss of the ocean depths,<lf>there's nothing quite like it!
<string>Purrhaps I'm mistaken, but I think I<lf>just heard the departure signal?
<string>But if I leave now, I've got the Felyne<lf>I'm gonna miss out on something big!
<string>Although my bobber hasn't bobbed...<lf>At all.
<string>Well this is awkward...
<string>I swear, I never catch any fish when<lf>someone is watching!
<string>I like to fish like this when I have time<lf>off work, which hasn't been much lately.<lf>I'll catch one fur sure next time!
<string>If you happen to find a good fishing<lf>spot somewhere, don't tell anyone, OK?<lf>Just keeping it between me and you!
<string>That's something worth investigating,<lf>don'tcha think? I know I do!
<string>Off to the Jungle, Hunter? Are you going<lf>fishing out there?
<string>...No? Well in that case, I'll just stay here then.
<string>Whoever was yelling early scared away<lf>all the dang fish! I was so close to nabbing<lf>one too...
<string>Maybe they were mad because I skipped<lf>out on work to go fishing... Heh.
<string>It may not seem like it, but I'm deeply<lf>concerned about all these Kingdom<lf>meownsters.
<string>I don't know what I'll do if all the fish<lf>disappear!
<string>I'm counting on you, Hunter!
<string>I'm afraid I'm of no use to you<lf>right meow...
<string>Have you heard the mews?<lf>There is a shadow lurking in the area...<lf>Something bad is about to happen...
<string>...Meow MEOW!? Meow...<lf>It got away!
<string>So...what were we talking about?
<string>Everyone is doing their best to investigate<lf>the Kingdom's meownsters. I'm trying my<lf>hardest, too!
<string>I'm in the middle of an investigation to<lf>see how meownsters from the Kingdom<lf>influence fishing around here!
<string>Fishing tips you say? I'm not surprised<lf>you've come to me. After all, I am the<lf>best angler in Elgado.
<string>Focus on the number of times the "bobber"<lf>or "fishing float" sinks. The first time is too<lf>soon, look out for the second time!
<string>Take a deep breath and don't be too hasty.<lf>Oh, you knew about this? In that case,<lf>there's nothing more to teach you!
<string>You know, in all my years of fishing I've<lf>never caught an Aurora Somnacanth.
<string>But one day I know I will, and I'm sure<lf>it'll be one heck of a ride. I hope you'll<lf>be there by my side, Hunter.
<string>I want to try using those Qurio-thingies<lf>you caught as bait. You think they'd be<lf>any good?
<string>If we used 'em, maybe we can catch<lf>something REALLY big! I might give<lf>it a try...
<string>I heard that Qurio can bite chunks out<lf>of meownsters...
<string>Maybe it's a good thing I didn't try to<lf>use 'em as bait.
<string>I'm going to try and be more useful<lf>around here. If you need anything for<lf>the medicine, I'll do all I can to help!
<string>...but only if it's something I can catch<lf>around here.
<string>Good news is that if you can't use<lf>my catch for medicine, you can have<lf>it for dinner!
<string>I haven't been able to catch any fish<lf>lately, which is strange. It was never<lf>like this before...
<string>I think you may have taken all my luck<lf>with you... No need to worry! I'm sure<lf>it'll come back around.
<string>Purr-omise me you'll use that luck<lf>to catch a big one for me!
<string>Is this it? Is this the end? Will it finally<lf>be over? We've overcome a lot to get<lf>to this point.
<string>Now that things have quieted down here<lf>in Elgado, I can finally concentrate<lf>on fishing!
<string>Now that you've defeated Malzeno, why<lf>not use the materials you obtained<lf>to make a pawsome fishing rod?
<string>......<lf>On second thought, you purr-obably<lf>shouldn't.
<string>There's no tellin' what kind of scary fishy<lf>that cursed thing would catch!
<string>Looks like it's gotten a little cloudy.<lf>You know, you can catch more fish in<lf>this kind of weather than you think.
<string>Why? Oh, it's because—<lf>Uh, actually, I'm not quite sure either...
<string>Purrhaps it's just a superstition?<lf>Anyway, there is only one way to find out!
<string>You're purr-obably well aware that us<lf>Felynes hate getting wet. If someone were<lf>to sneak up behind me and push me in...
<string>I'd never fur-give them!<lf>No sneaking or pushing, OK?
<string>Hey, Hunter! I've been so busy getting <lf>this ship ready to set sail that <lf>I haven't had any time to fish.
<string>By the way, that meownster...<lf>"The Archdemon of the Abyss," was it?<lf>Sounds like a deep-sea fish to me.
<string>With all the scary meownsters gone,<lf>I could finally try my paw at ocean fishing.<lf>There'll be some big fish fur sure!
<string>Which means you'll have to hold on<lf>tight to me so that I don't get pulled<lf>into the water!
<string>Is there something you need?<lf>Purr-haps you're just bored?
<string>Me? I'm a little busy here—<lf>What? I don't "look" busy?
<string>Well, I guess purrhaps I don't...
<string>By the way, Hunter have you gotten your<lf>paws on the Deft-hand rod? What's that?<lf>Oh, it's an award for catching a lot of fish!
<string>Only those who have mastered the art<lf>of fishing have one. It's an honor that<lf>fishing enthusiasts aim to get.
<string>...Who me?<lf>Do I have one—? Hey, I asked you first!
<string>Mew would not believe what happened<lf>the other day! While you were gone I fished<lf>up a Jyuratodus?
<string>......?<lf>"Yeah, you're right! I don't believe you!"!?
<string>I'm not lying, it's the truth I swear!<lf>There's no way I dreamt that up!<lf>Or maybe I did...?
<string>You're not very busy today, are you?<lf>Wish I could say the same...
<string>Why don't I ever fish in the crater!?
<string>Uh...isn't it obvious!?<lf>What am I gonna do if I reel in Malzeno<lf>or something!?
<string>Hey, Hunter!<lf>...Hmm? When am I ever gonna do some<lf>work around here?
<string>I work...all the time. Y-You're just not here<lf>when I work.
<string>Why, I was just working right before you<lf>came. Just about wore my toe beans down<lf>I was working so hard!
<string>Hey, Hunter! One of these days you<lf>think you can take me to Kamura and<lf>show me around?
<string>Give me the grand tour, y'know? And,<lf>of course, you gotta show me all your<lf>super-secret fishing spots!
<string>*ahem* On my day off, that is. I'd never<lf>skip out on work to enjoy a fishing trip<lf>to Kamura. Not me, no siree!
