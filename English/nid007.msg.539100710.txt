<string><NOFAC>Hm? Here on purr-sonal business?<lf>'Cause the Buddy Smithy's not open yet.
<string>Come back when we're done setting up!
<string><PL>!<lf>So I hear you're a hunter meow.<lf>Fur-licitations and congratulations!
<string>The Smithy looks forward to your future<lf>patronage! And your Buddy's of course!
<string><NOFAC><PL>!<lf>So I hear you're a hunter meow.<lf>Fur-licitations and congratulations!
<string>If ya need Buddy equipment, then look no fur-<lf>ther. The Smithy looks forward to your future<lf>patronage! And your Buddy's too, of course!
<string>As a li'l token of my thanks, I'd like<lf>to purr-esent you with some <COLS RED>Scrap</COL> that<lf>you can use to forge Buddy equipment.
<string>Purr-omise me you'll take it and<lf>get your Buddies some spiffy<lf>new equipment!
<string>When you find mew materials,<lf>bring 'em here to me.
<string>I'll make you the best Buddy<lf>equipment fur miles around.
<string>Got it? Great!
<string>Today's spread is—uh, was—dango.
<string>I couldn't wait 'til lunch to eat 'em,<lf>so I told myself I'd have just one.
<string>They were gone faster than I thought<lf>paw-ssible! So much for portion control...
<string>Taking good care of your equipment?<lf>Bring it here and I'll make sure it's in<lf>top shape!
<string>The Rampage is prowling closer and closer...<lf>That can only mean trouble.
<string><PL>, make sure your Buddies<lf>are well-equipped for the fight!
<string><PL>! Are you OK?<lf>No scratches? Bruises? fur-actures?<lf>Spurr-ained ankles? Toothaches?
<string>Mew! What a relief.
<string>The craziest thing happened to me<lf>the other day. I'd forgotten my lunch,<lf>so Master Hamon offered me his.
<string>I wouldn't take it at first because then<lf>he wouldn't have anything to eat...<lf>But then he got pawfully angry!
<string>So, I said thank you and took it...<lf>It was so tasty!
<string>Whatever Master Hamon's invention is,<lf>you can bet it's paw-sitively ingenious.<lf>So don't you worry out there!
<string>Have ya taken a good look at Master<lf>Hamon's brilliant, amazing, absolutely<lf>GENIUS invention?
<string>I have, but...honestly, it was so incredible,<lf>I couldn't even fathom how it works! I must<lf>have asked him a meowllion questions!
<string>He looked fur-ious the whole time but<lf>he actually answered 'em all. What a guy!
<string>Got your Buddy Armor all in check? Just<lf>say the word and I'll fix it right up!
<string>There's a Buddy Smithy in the Gathering<lf>Hub too. Owned and opurr-ated by my<lf>good fur-iend Kojiri.
<string>Him and me, we've been pals ever<lf>since we appurr-enticed together.
<string>We even opened our smithies on<lf>the same day. You could say we're<lf>as much rivals as we are comrades.
<string>Seeing his work gets me all fired up<lf>like, "Are you kitten me? This guy<lf>has talent. I can't lose to him!"
<string>Everyone needs purr-oper equipment,<lf>be they human or Felyne!
<string>So, <PL>!<lf>Buy something, will ya?
<string>Mihaba spends a lotta time<lf>talking about Hinoa.
<string>Y'know, meow that I think about it,<lf>I've never heard Hinoa mention Mihaba...
<string>Not even once...<lf>Un-fur-tunate really.
<string>Neglecting your equipment's like<lf>catnapping on ice... A disaster<lf>waiting to happen.
<string>Make sure it's hunt-ready before you go!
<string>Hinoa's not looking too hot.<lf>Is she OK?
<string>Mihaba's fur-reaking out so bad<lf>even Meowster Hamon can't deal<lf>with him, so, I guess not...
<string>It's almost time for lunch, and<lf>today's mouth-watering spread<lf>is rice balls from Seihaku's shop!
<string>Oh, and how could I forget?<lf>A side of crispy, juicy veggies<lf>from Wakana's place, too!
<string>Huh, all this talking about lunch<lf>is working up my appetite.<lf>Maybe I should just eat it now.
<string>So, this whole Rampage thing is<lf>actually because the meownsters are<lf>running away from some angry dragon?
<string>A mass-migration to find refuge...<lf>Meow that I think about it,<lf>kinda makes sense.
<string>You're gonna go hunt this thing<lf>and give it what-fur, huh?<lf>...Hey, more power to you!
<string>What's that? Are you worried<lf>about the village?
<string>Heh, no need for that. I don't just<lf>make and sell weapons, you know.<lf>I can handle 'em pretty well, too!
<string>You're really something, <PL>!<lf>Even Meowster Hamon's impurr-essed!
<string>And since Meowster Hamon's basically<lf>a living legend, that kind of makes<lf>you a legend too!
<string>Hey, <PL>, <PL>!<lf>Listen to this!
<string>Just meow, Meowster Hamon looked<lf>at some of my work. He stared at it<lf>for a looong time and then nodded.
<string>How cool is that? A compliment from<lf>the great Meowster Hamon himself!<lf>Guess I'm a living legend now too!
<string>Heading meow-t?
<string>Make sure your Buddy equipment's all in order.<lf>...Oh, and yours too!
<string>I'm looking forward to the tails<lf>about the big hunt already!
<string><PL>! You're back!<lf>You're really back!
<string>And without a scratch or even a hang nail!
<string>Hm? Both those dragons are still<lf>alive, and you're on a mission<lf>to stop 'em once and fur all?
<string>Well, you'll be needing even better<lf>Buddy equipment for the task, won'tcha?
<string>OK! This is the purr-fect oppurr-tunity<lf>to show off my new and impurr-oved skills!
<string>All geared up 'n' ready to go?<lf>Don't fur-get your Buddy's<lf>kit too!
<string>You're going up against two elder dragons,<lf>after all. Ya gotta be as surely sure as you<lf>can surely be fur-st!
<string>Master Hamon's been saying that you've<lf>become "dignified..." Or something.
<string>If I take a good look at you... I guess so,<lf>huh? Either way if it's good enough for<lf>Master Hamon, it's good enough for me!
<string>Leave it to ol' Kisaki to outfit your<lf>Buddies with Kamura's best!
<string>I might not exactly be an expurr-t<lf>yet, but I'll be learning as I go along.<lf>You can count on that!
<string>Kamura Steel is really somethin'.<lf>Its purr-ity and strength are unmatched.
<string>The only catch is it's kinda unwieldy.<lf>But that's where us smiths come in,<lf>making it easier to handle!
<string>It's almost lunch time...<lf>I can do this, I can wait—
<string>*RUMBLE*
<string>Scratch that, I don't think my stomach<lf>can wait after all. It's munch time!
<string>Just a bit of this and a little bit of<lf>that, and few of those, and...
<string>Oh meow what!? Darn it, now it's too heavy!<lf>Why!? Oh, because the middle's too thick...
<string>I wish I could just eyeball this stuff<lf>like Meowster Hamon does...<lf>Guess purr-actice makes purr-fect, huh?
<string>*sigh* Really wish I could try out all<lf>these ideas I have! Use this material<lf>with a little bit of this material...
<string>Or try some cool combinations. This helm<lf>with this chest piece... I could even<lf>come up with something totally mew!
<string>Or I could even make my very own<lf>invention like Meowster Hamon, but...
<string>I'll never be able to do all that in<lf>one lifetime... Good thing I have<lf>nine!
<string>Mihaba's passion for his work is almost<lf>as big as his passion for Hinoa.
<string>He's always talking about how he visited<lf>different smithies outside Kamura.
<string>But at the end of it all, he says our<lf>Meowster Hamon's still the best around.
<string>Knowing I work under the meowster of<lf>all smithing meowsters makes me one<lf>happy Felyne!
<string>You'll be sur-purr-ised, trust me!
<string><PL>! I've got a special surprise<lf>fur ya!
<string>Ready? It's a purr-etty big deal!<lf>OK... Now I can forge <COLS RED>layered armor fur</COL><lf>your Buddies!
<string>Some Buddies are cool with the casual look,<lf>but sometimes ya gotta spice things up. Now,<lf>when that's the case, you can come to me!
<string>One, two, three...
<string>Yup, that's all of 'em!
