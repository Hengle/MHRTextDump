<string>I did my stretches and ate a<lf>huge meal. Ready for anything!
<string>No matter what kind of quest,<lf>I've got you covered.
<string>I'm functioning at peak<lf>performance. Top notch!
<string>Usually I'm at 100%.<lf>But today? 110% at least!
<string>'Bout to put everything Master<lf>Arlow taught me to use!
<string>Hey, <PL>!<lf>Nothing is stopping me today!
<string>Cheers, <PL>!<lf>I had a feeling you'd come!
<string>I'm ready to learn a thing<lf>or two from you today!
<string>I'm so glad you came.<lf>Huntin' alone is such a drag.
<string>OK, Basarios! Ready or not,<lf>here we come!
<string>Kamura's hero and their<lf>teacher! And me in the mix!
<string>Wow! This is some pretty<lf>inspiring stuff! Top notch!
<string>And I'll try to live up to the name<lf>of a knight of the Royal Order!
<string>Alright everyone!<lf>Welcome to the Sir Jae Show!
<string>I'll hope you'll tell the Admiral<lf>about my sweet moves!
<string>I'd expect no less from you, Fiorayne.<lf>No one knows me better than you!
<string>You mean watch and learn, right?<lf>Got it! LET'S DO THIS!
<string>With you two backing me up, maybe<lf>I can try out a new technique today!
<string>Don't worry! Besides, Master<lf>Arlow said I should give it a try!
<string>I don't know why he couldn't stop<lf>laughing though!
<string>I'm just a little nervous,<lf>that's all. I'll be fine!
<string>I think I just ate too much Bunny Dango.<lf>Like 50 plates or something...
<string>Wow! This is so cool! Hunting with<lf>the Admiral AND <PL>!
<string>I'm so nervous to hunt with the Hero<lf>of Kamura! How about you Admiral?
<string><PL>! You went hunting<lf>with the Admiral and didn't invite me!?
<string>I've waited for this day for so long!<lf>Finally hunting with the Admiral!
<string>I have no idea what that<lf>means, but it sounded cool!
<string>Me? Cold feet!? Ye...<lf>Yes—I mean, no! No!
<string>O-Our last? Wh-What? D-Do<lf>you know something I don't!?
<string>I hope I get to hunt with "normal"<lf>Luchika today...
<string>Y-Yes, t-totally agree! Got it!
<string>My muscles are primed and ready<lf>for hunting!
<string>Time to flex on some monsters!<lf>Right, Luchika?
<string>Yes, sir—I mean, ma'am!<lf>Er, sorry...!
<string>I've been working out every day, so<lf>I hope I can keep up with you two!
<string>Something tells me I'm about to<lf>witness something awesome!
<string>Yes! I recently learned how to<lf>stir-fry some veggies!
<string>So...what kind of training<lf>do you do in your village?
<string>Whoa! I hope I get to try this Toadversary-<lf>thing everyone's talking about someday!
