<string>Meowllo, <PL>!
<string>Doin' some shopping? Well then,<lf>how 'bout some fish?
<string><PL>, I heard the mews!<lf>You're a hunter now?
<string>What a supurrb accomplishment!<lf>Why not have some fish to celebrate?
<string>Meowllo, <PL>!<lf>Congratulations!
<string>Now go on, have some fish! Why?<lf>'Cause fish are packed to the gills<lf>with all the mew-trition a hunter needs!
<string>So eat up! If this ain't enough fur ya,<lf>I'll go reel in a fur-resh catch right now!
<string>Hey, <PL>!<lf>How about some fresh catch?
<string>Just caught 'em a moment ago, so they're<lf>as fresh as they come! C'mon, buy one,<lf>or two...or a whole paw-ful!
<string>Say, <PL>, you ever been<lf>to the Frost Islands?
<string>I go fishing there on occasion, but<lf>somehow, I always get distracted<lf>and end up making snowcats instead.
<string>If you ever come across one of my<lf>meowsterpieces, you better not mess<lf>it up, got it? I'm not kitten around here.
<string>Bunny Dango are good, but so are fish!
<string>I'll be munching on the dango<lf>while I'm fishing away.
<string>And then I'll go buy more dango<lf>while I eat the fish I caught. A flawless<lf>plan that's never failed me.
<string>Say, <PL>, you ever been<lf>to the Frost Islands?
<string>I go fishing there on occasion, but<lf>somehow, I always get distracted<lf>and end up making snowcats instead.
<string>If you ever come across one of my<lf>meowsterpieces, you better not mess<lf>it up, got it? I'm not kitten around here.
<string>Fish have boatloads of mew-tritional value.
<string>And mew-trition is key to man and Felyne's<lf>health alike. If you want a strong body,<lf>then eating fish is the way to go!
<string>Ah, <PL>!<lf>Facing off against the Rampage?
<string>You should eat some of the fish<lf>I caught to give you strength!
<string><PL>!<lf>You're back, and not missing a single hair!
<string>Heh, I bet it's thanks to all the energy<lf>you got from eating our fine catch.
<string>Here, I'll throw in some extra<lf>fur you today! Bon appétit!
<string>What's that? Why don't I wear clothes?<lf>Hah! Clothes are overrated. Much too<lf>cumbersome fur a working Felyne!
<string>Ain't no time to be thinkin' about<lf>your looks! When you see fish<lf>swimming about, you gotta be quick.
<string>You gotta be ready to pounce<lf>with no hesitation!
<string>It's all in the split-second reaction,<lf>see?
<string>Going after that Magnamalo,<lf>are you, <PL>?
<string>It sounds scary. Just saying<lf>its name makes my fur bristle.
<string>But we know you're strong and that<lf>you'll be fine! Just eat your fish to<lf>make sure you have the upper paw!
<string><PL>!<lf>Is it true? You hunted Magnamalo?<lf>Well done! Was it very difficult?
<string>Difficult like catching the oldest fish in the<lf>lake—a beast of a fish, ancient and sly?
<string>WHAT? Even harder than that!?
<string>That's...That's incredible!<lf>I can hardly believe it.
<string>You should try not wearing clothes.<lf>So many things are easier without<lf>them, like diving into water.
<string>Besides, it's dangerous to swim<lf>with your clothes on. Better safe<lf>than sorry, am I right?
<string>Oh, you're headed to the Hub too<lf>are you, <PL>?
<string>I take it you'll be having a couple<lf>of drinks there too, eh?
<string>Ya know, nothing complements spirits<lf>more than fish! A pur-fect match, if ya<lf>ask me! C'mon, buy some!
<string>Tsuriki always brings us the goods<lf>that arrive at the docks, every day.<lf>Can't thank him enough for that.
<string>One time I gave him my catch as thanks,<lf>but then he got veggies from Wakana,<lf>Komitsu's candy, Seihaku's rice balls...
<string>And Tsuriki ended up with more<lf>goods than he started with. I felt<lf>kinda bad as he staggered away.
<string>Oh, Seihaku's such a shy boy!
<string>Why? Surely you know about...
<string>Nah, I don't wanna be the one<lf>to let the cat out of the bag.
<string>Aw, it's just such a cute situation!<lf>But also kinda awkward.
<string>What? The Rampage's coming?<lf>Oh meow! OK, think... What could<lf>I do at a time like this?
<string>Oh I know! I'll go catch<lf>fish for everyone to eat!
<string>I'll save some for you, <PL>!<lf>We've gotta make sure you're at full<lf>strength and ready to go!
<string>So...I heard Hinoa's resonating<lf>with a serpent or something?
<string>That girl's one of my best customers.<lf>She always buys a boatload of fish.
<string>And to have someone who eats<lf>THAT much fish getting sick...well,<lf>things must be really serious.
<string>I better stop by to bring her more fish<lf>later. Hmm, what kind should I bring?
<string>I always get asked why<lf>I don't wear clothes.
<string>Some people have told me that I should<lf>get into the habit of wearing them.
<string>But you know what? I'm proud<lf>of who I am. I don't need to hide<lf>that to try to please other people.
<string>I'm pur-fectly handsome with<lf>or without clothes, after all.
<string>Wakana gave me some veggies,<lf>saying I should eat 'em more.
<string>I don't usually like veggies,<lf>but I do like the ones she sells.
<string>When I bite into 'em, they make this<lf>amazing crunch sound and are<lf>completely bursting with flavor.
<string>So Hinoa's going to be OK if that Ibushi<lf>monster's defeated?
<string>Please, <PL>.<lf>We're counting on you!<lf>Beat that Ibushi down!
<string>Oh, and don't forget to buy some fish!
<string>Hey, <PL>!<lf>I heard you drove off that Ibushi!
<string>That's incredible! OK, so you know<lf>what you've got to do meow, right?
<string>You need to tell everyone<lf>that it's all thanks to your<lf>healthy diet of fish!
<string>Hey <PL>!<lf>Things are going great around here.
<string>The catch has been awesome.<lf>I jump into the water, and it's like<lf>the fish come swimming towards me!
<string>Here!<lf>I'll share some of them with ya!
<string>Should fill you up before your hunt!
<string>Ah, <PL>.<lf>So it's time then?
<string>I'll have the best tastin' fish<lf>prepared for ya, so make sure<lf>you work up a good appetite.
<string>Good luck meow!
<string>Hey, the hero's back! Hahaha,<lf>no need to be humble meow!
<string>I know those serpents are still alive,<lf>but as long as you're with us<lf>this village has nothing to fear!
<string>Still, you gotta prepare!<lf>Being a hunter is a physical job.<lf>And eating fish makes you strong!
<string>Hey <PL>!<lf>Going out hunting?
<string>I was about to go fishin' myself!
<string>Why don't you eat something too?<lf>C'mon, have some fish!
<string>Elder dragons have got nothin' on you!<lf>A hunter like you, who eats this much fish,<lf>can take 'em down easy, guaranteed!
<string>A fishy diet helps you dodge 'cause they're<lf>good for your eyes, helps you take blows<lf>'cause they're good for the bones, and...
<string>Anyway, I just wanted to say good luck<lf>to ya. Now go kick their tail ends with<lf>the power of fish!
<string>With the Rampage over, things'll go back<lf>to how they used to be, with travelers<lf>from all over payin' visits to the village.
<string>And when they do, I'm gonna<lf>purr-sent them all with the best<lf>fish Kamura has to offer!
<string>Oooh, I'm gettin' excited already<lf>just thinking about it!
<string>Yomogi's got some really good eyes.<lf>She's able to spot potential customers<lf>a mile away.
<string>Must be thanks to all the<lf>fatty fish she eats!
<string>C'mon, <PL>.<lf>You should buy some too!<lf>Taste and fur-eshness guaranteed!
<string>Hinoa's skin is always so shiny<lf>and firm. She's simply glowing!
<string>Ya know, fish are full of healthy oils<lf>that make yer skin silky smooth.
<string>C'mon, <PL>.<lf>You should buy some too!<lf>Taste and fur-eshness guaranteed!
<string>Iori's got strong teeth and bones.<lf>This one time, he fell out of a really<lf>tall tree but only got a few scratches.
<string>It must be thanks to eating all those<lf>tiny fish! I mean, you can eat those<lf>things whole!
<string>C'mon, <PL>.<lf>You should buy some too!<lf>Taste and fur-eshness guaranteed!
<string>Master Hojo's always energetic.<lf>He says he's never even caught<lf>a cold before.
<string>I bet it's the glittery blue-backed fish<lf>doing its job!
<string>C'mon, <PL>.<lf>You should buy some too!<lf>Taste and fur-eshness guaranteed!
<string>Kagero's a really smart guy.<lf>When I bought a bunch of stuff,<lf>he added up the total cost in no time.
<string>Definitely thanks to the blue-backed<lf>fish...or tuna? Maybe both!
<string>How about you, <PL>?<lf>C'mon, buy some too!<lf>Trust me, you won't regret it!
<string>Elder Fugen is always so energetic.<lf>He's the very definition of healthy,<lf>with a body of steel.
<string>And all thanks to the power of fish.<lf>Eating fish makes everything better!
<string>How about you, <PL>?<lf>C'mon, buy some too!<lf>Trust me, you won't regret it!
