<string>Hey, <PL>.<lf>Finally leaving Kamura, are ya?<lf>Good on you!
<string>I hear the Kingdom's outpost has<lf>all the latest and greatest facilities.<lf>Can't even imagine what that's like.
<string>It must be jam-packed with hunters,<lf>so there's gotta be a Gathering Hub,<lf>right? Have you been to it yet?
<string>Give me a rundown next time you come<lf>through. I want to hear all about it! Well,<lf>good luck to ya out there!
<string>Heeeey! Welcome back, <PL>.<lf>How's Outpost life? Living the dream?
<string>Speaking of which, isn't that where<lf>Rondine's from?
<string>You wouldn't be interested in taking<lf>a few masks with you, would ya?<lf>They make great souvenirs!
<string>A few trinkets from your hometown<lf>would make for a great icebreaker,<lf>don't you think?
<string>Ah... But I guess they're more Master<lf>Utsushi than Kamura in the style<lf>department. But, hey, worth a try.
<string>Rondine mentioned the other day<lf>that Elgado could use some<lf>"botanical enrichment."
<string>Sounds like the place is pretty<lf>utilitarian. No room for blooms, just<lf>whatever they need for their work.
<string>Still, just look around you. I bet the<lf>place could do with a bit of color like<lf>Kamura. Might be worth mentioning?
<string>Easier said than done, given the climate.<lf>I'll need more info before I can suggest<lf>or do anything.
<string>Hey! Think you can look into it next time<lf>you're out there? Weather, soil—or, uh,<lf>maybe it'd be faster if I just went?
<string>Rondine says they don’t grow flowers<lf>out in the Outpost, but surely they grow<lf>them in the Kingdom, right?
<string>Given the soil and meteorologic<lf>conditions, there must be all sorts<lf>of flora we’ve never seen before.
<string>I get all jazzed up just thinking about it!<lf>Maybe Hobashira can bring me back<lf>something next time he comes through.
<string>Hobashira brought back some flowers<lf>from the Kingdom. Said these things<lf>are everywhere.
<string>You won't find anything like them around<lf>here and they're so vibrant! I want to get<lf>'em into soil ASAP. I can't wait!
<string>But I'll have to see how they behave in pots<lf>first. Who knows how the insects, other<lf>plants—heck, even animals would react?
<string>Either way, I'm glad Hobashira could come<lf>through. Just what you’d expect from a<lf>guy with merchant hookups everywhere!
<string>Well, look who it is! The village hero!<lf>Or is it the Kingdom hero, now?<lf>Either way, welcome back!
<string>Did you get mobbed by all the kids when<lf>you stepped through the village gates?<lf>You're all they've been talking about!
<string>Can't blame 'em though. Because of<lf>the Rampage, barely anyone has been<lf>outside of Kamura.
<string>Talk of the outside world is rare enough,<lf>but tales of a village hunter vanquishing<lf>monsters in a faraway kingdom? Ha!
<string>You know everyone's chomping at<lf>the bit for more. I'd be lying if I said<lf>I wasn't one of 'em!
<string>When you have a moment, you gotta<lf>fill everyone in on your escapades!<lf>Oh, and uh...save me a seat?
