<string>This building was familiar; he knew it<lf>too well... But no wonder he couldn't<lf>find it—it'd been buried under the sand.
<string>After fighting through the humidity and<lf>countless squalls, I finally found the<lf>ruins. Now it's time to get to work.
<string>There's a large square at the center<lf>of the ruins. It's obviously man-made,<lf>as it's surrounded by murals.
<string>It's a miracle that these murals survived<lf>this heat and humidity. I should observe<lf>them carefully.
<string>One of the murals depicts a large dragon,<lf>soaring through the sky on steel-blue<lf>wings.
<string>Next to it is a picture of humans bowing<lf>and kneeling before the mighty gales<lf>its wings produce.
<string>Perhaps this used to be a shrine where<lf>they performed rituals to placate the<lf>dragon.
<string>The mural continues. There are people<lf>grabbing spears as if to stand up<lf>against this humongous monster.
<string>The tribe that created this shrine must've<lf>found a way to rebel against the creature,<lf>rather than remain subservient to it.
<string>As I take notes, it strikes me that<lf>I may be witnessing the birth of<lf>us hunters.
<string>I have to wrap up my report and return<lf>to the Guild post-haste, rain and<lf>humidity be damned!
<string>I am a knight who swore loyalty to the<lf>Kingdom. These are the final memories<lf>of this town and my best friend.
<string>This town was built around a citadel.<lf>The guards here had nothing to stave<lf>off but the cold. It was peaceful but dull.
<string>However, this led to a lack of vigilance,<lf>causing us to overlook the beginnings<lf>of a tiny anomaly.
<string>The creatures living near the city suddenly<lf>became violent. At first only a few,<lf>but every day there were more.
<string>And then one night, monsters began attacking,<lf>sieging the walls and destroying the town and<lf>the citadel. We were all caught off-guard...
<string>The townsfolk panicked in the dark and ran to<lf>escape. It was pure pandemonium. My fellow<lf>knights were slaughtered one by one.
<string>One of the monsters was unlike anything<lf>I had seen before, but its appearance reminded<lf>me of the dragon of old legends—Malzeno.
<string>I was paralyzed with fear. It was then that<lf>I noticed a young boy squirming for his life<lf>underneath the dragon's claws...
<string>My brave friend slashed at the beast to<lf>protect the boy, but he hardly made a<lf>scratch. He urged me to flee with the child.
<string>I took the boy's hand and escaped the ruins<lf>of the city as my friend fought Malzeno.<lf>In the distance, the sun started to rise.
