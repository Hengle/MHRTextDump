<string><VO:SER>...Ah, hello, good Hunter. After Hinoa<lf>gave me the message, I came as<lf>quickly as I could.
<string>I had no choice but to ask Elder Fugen<lf>and Master Utsushi to cover my duties<lf>in my absence.
<string>My sister is sleeping now. I shall be tending<lf>to her duties for the time being.
<string>...Although the Admiral suggested I<lf>might wish to stay by Fiorayne's side.
<string>So whilst I appreciate the offer, we've<lf>caused enough inconvenience as it is...
<string><VO:SER>I've left my sister in Doctor Tadori's<lf>capable hands. I have other duties that<lf>require my attention.
<string>If I'm not working, my mind strays to<lf>unwelcome thoughts.<lf>...I don't need that.
<string><VO:SER>My sister is a woman of action, and will<lf>stop at nothing to achieve her goals.
<string>Do you remember what my sister said<lf>in Kamura Village? "We shall lay down<lf>our lives..."
<string>I believe one of the reasons Elder Fugen<lf>sent you here is because he sensed the<lf>danger in those words.
<string>As a result, you and the Admiral have<lf>helped my sister be more cautious, but<lf>in the end, it still wasn't enough...
<string>She did the right thing as a knight, to put<lf>others over herself. But still, as her family,<lf>it's... Well, it's a difficult issue.
<string><VO:SER>Doctor Tadori was kind enough to let me<lf>know that the medicine would soon be<lf>ready and that I shouldn't worry.
<string>I know we're not out of the woods yet,<lf>but I'm confident the legendary doctor<lf>has things under control.
<string>It's such a relief that suddenly...<lf>I feel absolutely exhausted...
<string>...No! There's no time to relax!<lf>I need to stay energized and focused<lf>on my duties here!
<string>Ah, hello, good Hunter. Thanks to your<lf>efforts, we seem to have weathered<lf>the worst of the storm now.
<string>The investigation work around Kamura<lf>has abated a little, too, so I found<lf>some time to come visit Elgado.
<string>...I must say, Master Utsushi really is<lf>an amazing man.
<string>Despite doing even more investigating<lf>than me, he's found time to come here<lf>regularly, as well as visit the capital.
<string>...Tell me, is he a man...or a god?
<string>There used to be talk among the knights<lf>that my sister doesn't much care for Bahari.
<string>And while on the surface that might appear<lf>to be true, especially to those that do not<lf>know them particularly well, I find it odd...
<string>Think about it. Admiral Galleus has tasked<lf>my sister with researching the Qurio...
<string>And whatever Bahari comes up with, everything<lf>he predicts or deduces, she accepts without<lf>question. Even if it makes no sense at all.
<string>Not something she would have done unless<lf>she had complete faith in the man. I'm rather<lf>jealous, to be honest...
<string>Nevertheless, I think it's fair to say<lf>that she does find Bahari a little<lf>irritating.
<string>Ah, hello again, good Hunter!<lf>Good to see you looking well.
<string>I've not come to Elgado as a knight today.
<string>I've come partly to see how my sister is,<lf>but also to bring special goods from<lf>Kamura in my capacity as a merchant.
<string>Master Utsushi's masks.<lf>They're fiercely popular here.
<string>I can understand why! They are made rather<lf>well. I might even keep one or two for myself!<lf>Perhaps you would like one, as well?
