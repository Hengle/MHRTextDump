<string>Pale moonlight, barely breaking<lf>through the clouds
<string>A creature wanders restlessly<lf>through the darkness
<string>Stepping firmly, never dropping its pace
<string>Its entire body honed to perfection
<string>Finally, the clouds split apart<lf>and the moon reveals itself
<string>Silver light illuminates the land<lf>and the mountains
<string>It dances, it runs, it trembles<lf>with unbridled power
<string>And with an entranced roar,<lf>it shows its true form
<string>Moonlight Nocturne
<string>Lunagaron
