<string><NOFAC>Meowllo there, <PL>.<lf>I've got a lot of vital information<lf>to go over with you.
<string>But I'm not quite ready yet...<lf>I'll give you a meow once<lf>I'm ready.
<string>It's very important!
<string><NOFAC><FCAM>Meowllo there, <PL>!<lf>Been waitin' on ya! Got some info that's<lf>vital—no, crucial—no, parameownt!
<string>Were ya just about to hit up<lf>the Gathering Hub so you can<lf>get a huntin' party together?
<string>Yeah, about that...<lf>I've got some bad news for you.
<string>Ya see, when the Rampage is near,<lf>it's fur-bidden fur hunters to<lf>leave Kamura.
<string>And outside hunters won't be able to<lf>enter either. In other words, Kamura<lf>is <COLS RED>"Offline."</COL>
<string>But if you want to form a party, I have<lf>a special type of message I can send to<lf>get hunters to hightail it here.
<string>If I send the message, Kamura will be<lf><COLS RED>"Online."</COL> And hunters will be able to<lf>enter. Just don't ask me how it works...
<string>I couldn't understand it myself.<lf>Something to do with spiderwebs...
<string>Anymew...<lf><COLS RED>Come to me whenever you want to<lf>swap between "Offline" and "Online!"</COL>
<string>By the way, did you talk with Minoto<lf>about Online quests yet?
<string>If you haven't, better get your tail in gear<lf>so you can go hunting with all your furr-iends!
<string>Say it with me, meow! "Online." "Offline."<lf>Got it? Good! Meow, don't fur-get!
<string>I'll be here if ya need me!
<string>With the Rampage appurr-oaching,<lf>my duties as a mailman have been<lf>put on hold...
<string>I thought I could just kick back and<lf>eat some dango, but Elder Fugen<lf>gave me this "Offline, Online" job.
<string>Which is totally cool with me. I really<lf>appurr-eciate that Elder Fugen trusts<lf>me with such an important task!

<string>I thought I could just kick back and<lf>eat some dango, but Elder Fugen<lf>gave me this "Offline, Online" job.
<string>Which is totally cool with me. I really<lf>appurr-eciate that Elder Fugen trusts<lf>me with such an important task!
<string>So, the Rampage is on the prowl...
<string>When I look towards the Stronghold,<lf>my whiskers get to twitchin'! Be careful<lf>meow-t there, <PL>.
<string>When Magnameowlo appeared, I thought you<lf>were done fur! Talk about close! Good thing<lf>Kamura Hunters have Wirebugs.
<string>But just imagine—If you defeat<lf>Magnameowlo, you'll be a legendary<lf>hunter! I think you can do it!
<string>My whiskers got to twitchin' again!<lf>That crazy Magnameowlo must be<lf>all riled up again...
<string>Meowster Hamon's thingymajiggle<lf>must of actually worked—not that<lf>I, uh, had any doubts it would...
<string>Magnameowlo must be mighty fur-ious right<lf>about meow! But you can do it, Hunter!<lf>Go and take that big ol' meownster down!
<string>Meow-tstanding, <PL>!<lf>Elder Fugen was mighty impurr-essed too!
<string>By the way, how are your Gathering Hub<lf>quests coming along?
<string>I can swap between Online and Offline faster<lf>than Hinoa can down dango! Well... Maybe<lf>not THAT fast, but you should still try it!
<string>Meow-tstanding, <PL>!<lf>Elder Fugen was mighty impurr-essed too!
<string>By the way, how are your Gathering Hub<lf>quests coming along?
<string>I can swap between Online and Offline faster<lf>than Hinoa can down dango! Well... Maybe<lf>not THAT fast, but you should still try it!
<string>There's a huge horde of meownsters<lf>appurr-oaching! Maybe the biggest<lf>horde yet...
<string>Make full use of the Stronghold<lf>to keep 'em at bay. It might seem<lf>impawsible, but you can do it!
<string>We all knew the Rampage would have<lf>casualties, but not like what Hinoa's<lf>going through...
<string>You gotta do somethin' about that blue<lf>monster! I can't bare to see our purr-ecious<lf>Hinoa suffering this way...
<string>Off to put an end to Ibushi?
<string>I've had my fill of this whole Rampage<lf>catastrophe—time to put an end to it.
<string>Hinoa was released from Ibushi's grasp,<lf>but the Rampage continues. I'm half<lf>relieved, half disappointed...
<string>Figures... This thing's been going on<lf>fur-ever. Of course it wouldn't be so<lf>easy. So keep at it!
<string>I was worried when I heard Minoto resonated<lf>with Narwa, but she's just purr-ancin' around<lf>like nothing's wrong!
<string>It really did a number on Hinoa, so why's<lf>Minoto all rainbows and butterfur-lies?
<string>This is it, <PL>!<lf>Time to give that blue meownster the beatdown<lf>of nine lifetimes! Are you ready!? Pumped!?
<string>If not, I can recite this daily affur-mation<lf>I usually say to myself every morning in<lf>the mirror. Gets me meowtivated for the day—
<string>What's that? Y-You're good?<lf>Well, suit yourself...
<string>Meow both Hinoa AND Minoto are resonating<lf>with those meownsters!?
<string>But it's like their bodies've adapted.<lf>It's good that Hinoa isn't suffering<lf>like before...but still kinda worrying.
<string>If Ibushi and Narwa meet up, it won't be<lf>purr-etty. You gotta stop that happening!
<string>As if those two meownsters weren't<lf>bad enough, meow all sortsa other<lf>meownsters keep cropping up.
<string>Do you think it's because of Ibushi and Narwa?
<string>Causing the Rampage and bringing out<lf>all sorts of baddies... We have to do<lf>something about those two!
<string>Yikes! My whiskers're gettin' to twitchin'<lf>again!
<string>Ibushi and Narwa must still have some<lf>fight left in 'em, huh?
<string>I've had my fill of this whole Rampage<lf>catastrophe—it's time to put the final nail<lf>in their coffin, <PL>!
<string>Now that you've stamped out the Rampage,<lf>I can finally get back to delivering mail<lf>stat. No paws, no delay, nothin'!
<string>...In theory, anyway. I kept up my running<lf>this whole time so I'd stay in prime mail-<lf>cat shape, but meow...I'm sore all over.
<string>So do you ever hang out with other hunters?
<string>You can go questing with a trusty group<lf>of hunting friends, or join forces with<lf>pawrtners you might never see again!
<string>And while it's fun to hunt with others, it's<lf>also a good learning experience! Check out<lf>how your pals use their weapons or items!
<string>The most important thing when hunting in<lf>a group has got to be coordination. Things<lf>can quickly get out of paw if you don't!
<string>There are several ways to do so,<lf>like chatting or using gestures.
<string>Commew-nication is key to a great hunt<lf>and a quest complete!
<string>Got a li'l somethin' fur ya!
<string><NOFAC>Hey, <PL>!<lf>Your hunting pawtners can send you<lf><COLS RED>Likes</COL> to show that they trust ya!
<string>And if you get a whole bunch<lf>of Likes, guess what? I'll give<lf>ya somethin' special to boot!
<string>Use this in a quest and get even<lf>more Likes fur-rom your fur-riends!
<string>Got a li'l somethin' fur ya!
<string><NOFAC>Hey! <PL>! Looks like<lf>you collected a litter o' Likes,<lf>so I've got somethin' special fur ya!
<string>Use this in a quest and get even<lf>more Likes fur-rom your fur-riends!
<string>Hey, something came in fur you!
<string>Oh, <PL>! There's some<lf>new add-on content available<lf>for your purr-usal!
