<string>ZZZZzzzz...<lf>*yawn*<lf>...Oh, it's you, <PL>.
<string>Now, what business do you have<lf>waking me from my glorious little<lf>catnap?
<string>Aren't you supposed to be shopping<lf>right now? Go on, get outta here.<lf>ZZZZzzzz...
<string>ZZZZZ—<lf>What do you want, <PL>?
<string>I'm in the middle of a nap here.<lf>Lemme have my shuteye already.
<string>Ah, not a single patient today...<lf>A doctor with this much free time<lf>is one lucky Felyne. *yawn*
<string>Oh, it's you, <PL>.<lf>Well well, you're a hunter now, eh?
<string>You know, it's very important to me that,<lf>despite my medical talents, everyone stays<lf>healthy—and I stay permanently unoccupied.
<string>...Well, you've always been a strong and healthy<lf>kitten; I suppose I've little need to worry that your<lf>choice of careers'll change anything. *yawn*
<string>What's wrong, <PL>?<lf>Scrape a knee?
<string>Give it a good lick and you'll be Felyne fine!<lf>That's my professional advice.
<string>*yawn*
<string>Ugh... My fur stands on end<lf>whenever I see a Canyne.
<string>Inukai's Buddy, Goka...<lf>I know she's harmless, but I can't<lf>help but feel uneasy around her.
<string>You know what's really funny?<lf>Inukai says Goka's the one<lf>who's afraid of ME.
<string>Something to do with some bitter<lf>medicine I made her drink a while<lf>back when she caught a cold.
<string>Yeesh! The burdens I bear<lf>as a doctor, I tell ya.
<string>I'm hungry after that catnap. Maybe<lf>I'll go grab some Bunny Dango.
<string>I hope you're eating them too,<lf><PL>.
<string>You know what they say: "A dango<lf>a day keeps the doctor away."
<string>Everyone in this village eats 'em,<lf>works hard, and gets plenty of sleep.<lf>No wonder we're all so healthy.
<string>As always, I've only got time today.<lf>And that, my friend, is a blessing.<lf>*yawn*
<string>So, the Rampage is coming, is it?<lf>Well, don't you hunters fret. You have<lf>a world class doctor here, after all...
<string>*yawn*
<string>Heard you and some others were pounced<lf>on by Magnamalo. It's a relief everyone<lf>got away with not so much as a scratch.
<string>Guess that means I can get back<lf>to napping in peace... *yawn*
<string>What? Can't you see I'm tired?<lf>And you don't look like you're sick.<lf>Whatever it is you want, it can wait.
<string>I've only just finished helping<lf>out Kagero with his business.
<string>That was some hard work for these<lf>old paws of mine. A well-deserved<lf>catnap is in order...
<string>Huh. Taking the fight to Magnamalo,<lf>are you? Then you'd best be careful.
<string>Don't go getting hurt, ya hear?<lf>I don't want a reckless injury<lf>getting in the way of my naps.
<string>If it does, you're gonna have<lf>ointments smothered all over ya<lf>that'll sting so bad you'll regret it.
<string>Keep that in mind when you head out.<lf>Heh. Now if you'll excuse me... *yawn*
<string>What? Got beaten down<lf>by Magnamalo, did you?
<string>Only joking, hah! You look<lf>like you're in tip-top shape.
<string>You managed to save not only<lf>the village but also my precious<lf>nap time.
<string>You're one darn good hunter,<lf>you know that?<lf>*yawn*
<string>*yawn* You're always<lf>hard at work, aren't ya,<lf><PL>?
<string>Why not take a break sometimes?<lf>It's prime napping weather today.
<string>*yawn*
<string>Alcohol can be the best medicine.<lf>In moderation, of course,<lf>as with many other things.
<string>Enjoy the occasional drink and<lf>you'll never need a docto—*hic*
<string>Ah, <PL>. How goes it?<lf>Eating properly? Sleeping well?
<string>Don't forget to brush your teeth,<lf>now. And make sure you get<lf>those molars too.
<string>Instead of counting on me to fix you,<lf>ask me what you can do to prevent an<lf>ailment BEFORE it occurs. Understand?
<string>The best physicians aren't those who'll<lf>miraculously cure patients, but those<lf>who'll keep people from falling sick.
<string>And that concludes Doctor Zenchi's<lf>medical advice of the day. Looks like<lf>my work is done until tomorrow. *yawn*

<string>And that concludes Doctor Zenchi's<lf>medical advice of the day. Looks like<lf>my work is done until tomorrow. *yawn*
<string>What is it, <PL>? A large<lf>Rampage horde approaches, you say?
<string>Well, not to worry; I can treat<lf>any and all injuries. Just call<lf>for me if I'm need—
<string>What? No, I'm not being lazy.<lf>It's called "being on standby,"<lf>OK!? *yawn*
<string>I wasn't able to treat Hinoa...
<string>All I could do was give her something<lf>to ever so slightly ease the pain.
<string>She says it isn't a big deal, but...<lf>I know better. I can see how<lf>it's eating away at her.
<string>Folks call me a good doctor,<lf>and yet in times like these,<lf>I am utterly useless...
<string>What do you want, <PL>?<lf>Quit disturbing me while I'm trying<lf>to think.
<string>"Think about what?" About Hinoa and the<lf>serpent, what else? She may be fine now,<lf>but they could very well resonate again.
<string>I have to find some way of countering<lf>it ahead of time. It's the least I can do<lf>as a doctor.
<string>Let's see, if I grind some of this herb.<lf>Then take an extract from that blend.<lf>Do this, and add a little of that... *yawn*

<string>Let's see, if I grind some of this herb.<lf>Then take an extract from that blend.<lf>Do this, and add a little of that... *yawn*
<string>Wait, <PL>!<lf>Are you really taking on Ibushi!?
<string>Listen, about Hinoa. Despite my efforts,<lf>the most I can do is ease her pain.
<string>But if you defeat Ibushi, that would<lf>remedy the affliction!
<string>So it's all up to you now.<lf>We're all counting on you!
<string>Ah, <PL>.<lf>You defeated Ibushi, didn't you?<lf>Excellent.
<string>Gave it one heck of a bruising too,<lf>I hear. And I highly doubt Ibushi has<lf>a doctor as good as I it can count on.
<string>But more importantly, Hinoa seems<lf>to have made a full recovery.
<string>Why, you might be an even<lf>better doctor than I am!
<string>Just when Hinoa looks to be in the<lf>clear, Minoto goes and resonates too.<lf>*sigh* A doctor's work is never done.
<string>I've been doing what I can to<lf>identify her symptoms and<lf>treat them accordingly, but...
<string>Minoto's been oddly cheerful—<lf>happy to have the same powers<lf>as her sister, apparently.
<string>Can't say I get it, but...oh well.<lf>I'll give her some more medicine later.
<string>Listen, <PL>. Just...<lf>Come back in one piece, ya hear?
<string>Only small injuries are permissible, as<lf>I merely have to work my medical magic<lf>on them and you'll be as right as rain.
<string>Got it? Good. Off you go, then!
<string>I never expected both Hinoa and Minoto<lf>to start resonating at the same time.<lf>No rest for the weary ol' doc, eh?
<string>Still, my medicine shall alleviate<lf>their more troubling symptoms. Well,<lf>it should do...a little. Hopefully.
<string>I'll do everything I can to find a cure,<lf>but I'm afraid I'll have to leave<lf>trouncing Ibushi and Narwa to you.
<string>Don't let us down, now!
<string>*yawn* The folks in this village<lf>work so hard. But in my opinion,<lf>a little time off never hurts.
<string>That goes for you too, <PL>.<lf>Try taking things slow sometimes.
<string>Good sleep makes for good spirits.<lf>Resting well is critically important.
<string>You all ought to take me as an example.<lf>*yawn*
<string>If you can take out those serpents, that'll<lf>put an end to Hinoa's and Minoto's<lf>resonance, and the Rampage itself.
<string>We're counting on you, <PL>.<lf>End this calamity for us.
<string>Besides, this Rampage business's got<lf>me so busy, it even has me sacrificing<lf>my catnaps. Preposterous! *yawn*
<string>The Rampage looks to be on the way out.<lf>Well, since that's done and dusted now,<lf>why don't you take a little break, hmm?
<string>Eat when you're hungry; rest when you're<lf>tired; play when you wanna play. Even<lf>heroes need a balanced lifestyle, y'know.
<string>Now, that Hinoa sure eats a lot...
<string>Bunny Dango may be good for you, but<lf>with how many she wolfs down every day,<lf>you'd think she'd have stomach pains.
<string>Still, I haven't had to treat her for a<lf>case of indigestion yet; she can keep<lf>it up as long as that remains the case.
<string>Although, I am rather curious as to<lf>how that abyss of a stomach works...<lf>*yawn*
<string>Have you ever seen Yomogi<lf>prepare her Bunny Dango?
<string>She skewers them by throwing the sticks<lf>as one would a dart, and somehow manages<lf>to hit 'em dead center every time.
<string>That takes some serious paw-eye<lf>coordination, which is wasted at<lf>the Tea Shop, frankly.
<string>But I suppose she enjoys working<lf>there more than anywhere else.
<string>Finding fulfilment in your job is a<lf>wonderful thing. Can't say it motivates<lf>me to work any more though... *yawn*
<string>Seihaku currently suffers from an...<lf>"unsettled disposition" of sorts.
<string>One that even a doctor like myself<lf>is incapable of treating.
<string>You could say it's a bug we all catch at<lf>some point or another in our lives. But<lf>don't worry, I'll keep an eye on him.
<string>...Heh.
<string>Have you seen Hojo's art? The man has<lf>an incredible talent for capturing all<lf>the different features of every monster.
<string>My guess is he has an eidetic memory,<lf>and only has to look at something once<lf>to be able to replicate it on paper.
<string>They say drawing stimulates the brain.<lf>I wonder if that's how he developed<lf>that skill, or if it's simply inherent.
<string>Hmm... Or, maybe, it's a little bit of both.
<string>Being a physician in Kamura is an idle<lf>existence. Not that I'm complaining.
<string>Still, even in healthy communities like<lf>ours, we are needed every so often, so<lf>it's better for us to be there than not.
<string>My most serious case as Kamura's<lf>resident doctor, was, let's see...<lf>When Kagero came to the village.
<string>The man was terribly injured;<lf>so much so, I'd almost given up on him.
<string>But as you can see, he's now fit as<lf>a fiddle. I'm just that amazing. Heh!
<string>My, you hunters are really something.
<string>Hunting monsters here, gathering<lf>ingredients there...
<string>It's as if you all have an infinite<lf>pool of stamina to draw from.<lf>How do you manage to keep it up?
<string>I can't imagine doing what you do.<lf>I'd rather nap, myself, anyway...<lf>*yawn*
<string>Discounts, markdowns, and sales!<lf>Meow only!
