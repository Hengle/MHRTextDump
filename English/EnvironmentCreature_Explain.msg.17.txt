<string>A glowing caterpillar that secretes a sticky<lf>fluid to attach leaves or wood to its body,<lf>making it look larger. This bodily fluid is<lf>highly volatile, exploding when it is struck,<lf>acting as a self-defense mechanism.<lf>When applied, this explosive response to being<lf>hit helps mitigate some damage to the user.
<string>A large tortoise with an anthill on its back.<lf>If you capture it, the anthill absorbs damage<lf>for you when you take a fatal blow. Aurortles<lf>and the ants that reside in the anthill have<lf>a symbiotic relationship where the ants<lf>protect the shell with their hill, in exchange<lf>for the tortoise's food scraps and excrement.
<string>A butterfly with long wings. In flight, it looks<lf>like a flowing piece of cloth, giving it its name.<lf>When struck, it scatters a dust cloud and<lf>flees. The dust has a tightening effect on<lf>human skin making it more resistant to<lf>injury.
<string>A snake with an unusually developed<lf>neck region. Its body is filled with an<lf>antidote that works on various poisons.<lf>When a hunter absorbs it, ailments are<lf>healed, and resistance is heightened<lf>temporarily.

<string>A tiny beetle that pushes around a lava<lf>rock with its hind legs. The lava rock it<lf>pushes has fire properties, and throwing<lf>it at a target will inflict it with fireblight.<lf>The lava rocks may feel warm to hold,<lf>but hold them too long and you may<lf>get burned.
<string>Winged insects that emit a bright light when struck.<lf>To survive, Flashflies live together in a swarm and<lf>have a defense mechanism that allows them to emit<lf>a blinding flash if threatened, giving them time to<lf>flee to safety. The flash is so bright that it's possible<lf>to cause a large monster to flinch. Once the threat<lf>has disappeared the swarm will gather together again.
<string>A small lizard that lives in various locales. To<lf>protect itself from predators, Rock Lizards will<lf>attach minerals to their body in order to blend<lf>in with their surroundings. If attacked, they will<lf>shed these minerals and escape. They are<lf>popular among hunters as the minerals<lf>have many uses.
<string>A relative of the Rock Lizard, these lizards<lf>can also be found in a number of locales.<lf>Like the Rock Lizard, they also attach a <lf>variety of minerals to their bodies to protect<lf>themselves. However, these minerals are typically<lf>harder than those found on Rock Lizards<lf>and are more sought after by hunters.
<string>Relatives of the Rock Lizard, these lizards can<lf>also be found in a number of locales. Unlike the<lf>Rock Lizard, they don't attach minerals to their<lf>bodies—instead, they tend to use monster scales<lf>and claws. Scale Lizards are extremely rare as<lf>they inhabit areas seldom traveled. They are<lf>prized by hunters as the materials they drop<lf>fetch a high price.
<string>A weasel with distinct snow-white fur that is<lf>light and warm. When threatened, it emits<lf>a type of pheromone from the scent glands<lf>near the base of its tail in the form of a smoke-<lf>like cloud. It uses its tail to spread the cloud<lf>in an attempt to attract any monster nearby.<lf>If a monster is successfully lured to its<lf>location, it'll use this chance to escape.
<string>A large snail with a green shell. It stores fluids<lf>with healing properties in its body, consuming them<lf>when food is scarce.

<string>A spider with a distinct yellow-spotted pattern.<lf>It shoots out a sticky web from its abdomen<lf>that is robust enough to restrain monsters.<lf>When feeding or fleeing from enemies, it uses<lf>strings of web to immobilize its target. When<lf>feeding in particular, this behavior is reminiscent<lf>of a puppeteer manipulating a marionette, which<lf>is how its name came about.
<string>A pheasant with a giant red vocal sac.<lf>It sounds like a crying child, which it uses<lf>to attract large monsters that will, in turn,<lf>distract its predators. Hunters capture and use<lf>Wailnards to lure large monsters to their vicinity.<lf>It is a usually docile creature that spends most<lf>of its time in hiding. Despite its wings, it's not<lf>very good at flying.
<string>A beetle native to the Kamura area. This name<lf>refers to male Wirebugs, so called for their larger,<lf>more powerful bodies. As they are stronger than<lf>female Wirebugs, they are often used for long-<lf>distance movement, though they are less nimble<lf>and harder to control. They are also far less<lf>common than females. Once placed in a patch<lf>of Jewel Lilies, it'll never leave.
<string>A butterfly with crimson wings. In flight,<lf>they look like dancing flames and in the<lf>past, were often mistaken for fire or ghosts.<lf>When attacked, they release a type of dust<lf>before fleeing. This dust can temporarily boost<lf>attack strength if inhaled.
<string>A butterfly with spotted yellow wings that<lf>can be found living in swarms in various<lf>locales across the region. In the past they<lf>were mistaken for flying eyeballs hence their<lf>creepy name. When attacked, they release<lf>a type of dust before fleeing. This dust can<lf>temporarily boost stamina if inhaled.
<string>A golden beetle. When in flight, the sound of its<lf>wings flapping has a relaxing effect. Its diet mostly<lf>consists of other tiny insects. The ones that it favors<lf>most can be found on the plants that Petalaces are<lf>made from. Hunters wearing a Petalace will attract<lf>Golden Spiribugs and often return from hunts with<lf>their Petalace covered in them. A dye made from<lf>this bug is a famous specialty of Kamura Village.

<string>A squid that inhabits the Frost Islands,<lf>swimming in schools and spitting ink at threats.<lf>It emits a phosphorescence the same color as<lf>its ink, and can be sighted lighting up the seas<lf>like an underwater lamp, hence its name. Green<lf>Lampsquid ink has curative properties, healing<lf>injuries and wounds to an extent.
<string>A squid that inhabits the Frost Islands.<lf>Unlike other Lampsquid, it swims alone. It owes<lf>its aureate glow to its ink, which is known to<lf>promote concentration, fortitude, and the healing<lf>of any and all wounds. It is so rare that it has<lf>earned the name "King of the Lampsquid."
<string>A hermit crab native to the Sandy Plains.<lf>It sticks to cliffs in small groups and eats<lf>plants and smaller creatures there, dirt and<lf>all. The consumed dirt accumulates in the<lf>shell and is excreted when it's large enough.<lf>When attacked, the group goes into high<lf>alert, shooting lumps of earth at their attacker.
<string>Bats found in Lava Caverns. They live in groups<lf>and eat small flying bugs. Highly territorial, they<lf>will threaten invaders by turning themselves red<lf>and releasing scales that act like gunpowder to<lf>cause explosions large enough to hurt even large<lf>monsters.
<string>A fox that inhabits the Shrine Ruins. Extremely<lf>rare, it has been seen perched atop the gate leading<lf>into the Ruins.

<string>A rare snake that inhabits the Flooded Forest.<lf>It can fan out its neck, appearing like the wings<lf>of a bird, in a display used to threaten predators<lf>or attract mates. It secretes a fluid from its mouth<lf>that has healing properties. It used to be worshipped<lf>by humans, but this practice has disappeared over<lf>time, and now it just lives its enigmatic life free of<lf>all the fuss.
<string>A gigantic sea snail from the Frost Islands.<lf>It hates bright lights, and so remains in<lf>the sea during the day. At night, it surfaces<lf>where squids and other such potential prey<lf>gather. It possesses an organ that projects<lf>various patterns of light onto its skin.<lf>Its eyeball-like glow and colossal silhouette<lf>are the dread of every sailor in the region.
<string>A rare wingdrake of the Sandy Plains. It usually<lf>nests in caves, but will occasionally emerge<lf>to bask in the sun, improving its metabolism.<lf>On its head is a comb that looks like a winged<lf>crown or cape, which, combined with its glittering<lf>scales and languid form, gives it something of a<lf>regal air.
<string>A rare bird found near the crater of the Lava<lf>Caverns. Its vibrant red feathers grant it immunity<lf>to the dangers of magma. It bathes in lava to burn<lf>off germs and metabolic waste. This spectacle<lf>has resulted in it becoming a symbol of rebirth<lf>among mankind.
<string>An auspicious owl of this region, with golden<lf>feathers on its chest and a cat-like face. Due<lf>to its extreme rarity, it has been a symbol of<lf>wealth since ancient times. Those who encounter<lf>it are said to come into great fortune.

They are<lf>often used by hunters as a natural trap or as a<lf>means to slow down or turn away pursuers.
<string>This round rabbit may appear cute and fluffy,<lf>but its furry coat is actually made of mold.<lf>By allowing bacteria to grow on it, it gains<lf>an increased amount of nutrition from its food.<lf>Simply keeping this rabbit on their person can<lf>ferment a hunter's food for added nutritional<lf>value. As they are clever creatures, they usually<lf>escape their captors after a period of time.
<string>A frog known primarily for its distinctive red fins.<lf>It can puff itself up with pheromones to float like<lf>a balloon. Not one to shy away from confrontation,<lf>it instead spreads its menacing fins in a show of<lf>intimidation, even against much larger foes, though<lf>not always wisely. This show sometimes has the<lf>opposite effect, instead attracting predators. Thus,<lf>some hunters use it as a decoy, hence the name.
<string>A dragonfly with a sharp red tail that releases<lf>pheromones when under threat. During mating season,<lf>it rubs its tail on various surfaces to spread the<lf>chemical secretion. This action often cuts through<lf>fishing nets. As a result, Cutterflies are shrouded<lf>in superstition, particularly amongst fishermen.<lf>Breathing in the pheromone grants hunters increased<lf>concentration for a higher chance at critical hits.
<string>A terrestrial crab with mushrooms on its body.<lf>When attacked, it rustles its shell, causing the<lf>mushrooms to expel spores, which it uses for<lf>protection. It also feeds on insects that are<lf>attracted to fungi, forming a mutually beneficial<lf>relationship. The eyeball-like mushrooms on its<lf>back are extremely bitter and not suitable for<lf>consumption.
