<string>We finally got purr-mission from Sir<lf>Hamon to educate Kingdom smithies<lf>on the secrets of Kamew-ra steelwork.
<string>His finely-honed techniques can't be<lf>picked up by just any anvil banger, so<lf>I had the most qualified person sent here.
<string>In all honesty, I wish Sir Hamon had come<lf>to the Meowtpost with you because I don't<lf>plan on staying forever.
<string>But in the end, Sir Hamon's place is here<lf>just as my place is back in the Kingdom.
<string>The other day, Sir Hojo asked what the<lf>Kingdom meownsters looked like, so<lf>I gave him a simple explanation.
<string>And just from that, he drew splendid,<lf>striking renditions of the beasts—as if<lf>he'd seen them with his own eyes!
<string>Even fur-om a glance, anyone could tell<lf>the brushwork was his. I was reminded<lf>just how im-purr-essive he is.
<string>His skill is second to none. I must devote<lf>myself to im-purr-oving my own artistry,<lf>as well!
<string>...No, no, it's all wrong! Oh, what a mess.<lf>The piece is a su-purr special piece and<lf>I don't want to ruin it.
<string>I'm putting my heart and soul into<lf>purr-traying the beauty that is Kamew-ra<lf>Village.
<string>The dancing petals, the air of serenity;<lf>the pleasant scents, the abundance of<lf>smiling faces. I must capture them all.
<string>When I finish, I'm hoping to purr-esent it<lf>to Sir Hamon to show my ap-purr-eciation<lf>for everything he's done fur me—
<string>Meow no! Not again! I'm getting distracted!<lf>Focus, Chino, FOCUS!
<string>Our Lady's been rushing back and forth<lf>between Elgado and Kamew-ra ever since<lf>she heard news of her sister's injury.
<string>I tried to go with her, but she said needed<lf>us to manage the Argosy in her absence.
<string>I'm constantly im-purr-essed with Our Lady's<lf>wisdom. Even in a dire situation she is able<lf>to remain calm and make rational decisions.
<string>So Kotori and I will dedicate ourselves to<lf>our duty!
<string>I've tried really hard to capture the beauty<lf>of Kamew-ra but my vision just wouldn't<lf>meow-nifest on canvas...
<string>So I spoke with Sir Hamon... "Everyone<lf>hits a wall on occasion," he said. I couldn't<lf>believe that even HE sometimes struggles!
<string>Then he said, "Experience helps overcome<lf>some walls, but not all of them. Continued<lf>diligence is parameow-nt."
<string>Of course a mew-bie like me would<lf>splinter against the kind of walls<lf>Sir Hamon would come up against.
<string>Such a wall stands before me now,<lf>but I will con-fur-ont it to the best of<lf>my ability!
<string>At long last, my picture of Kamew-ra<lf>Village is complete! And I was finally<lf>able to purr-esent it to Sir Hamon!
<string>The whole time I was so worried about<lf>whether or not he would like it or not...
<string>But he said, "You should only concern<lf>yourself with doing the best you can<lf>when doing something for someone."
<string>"To think that 'someone' was myself<lf>leaves me humbled, indeed." And then<lf>he thanked me and took it!
<string>I'm so happy—ecstatic—MEW-PHORIC<lf>to think that the path of the painter has<lf>brought me to such a fur-tuitous juncture!
