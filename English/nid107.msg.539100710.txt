<string>Oh, it's you. The new hunter.<lf><PL>, right?
<string>I'm Ayame. I'm a high-rank<lf>hunter, for what it's worth.<lf>I was born here in Kamura too.
<string>I moved to another village at an early<lf>age, and became a hunter there, so that's<lf>why you wouldn't necessarily know me.
<string>I'm currently out of commission, though.<lf>I got hurt pretty bad out on a hunt, and<lf>I've been recovering ever since...
<string>Whether I'll be able to hunt again<lf>is up to fate now. I might have<lf>to consider other options.
<string>If you're going on a hunt, you'd best<lf>take an honest look at your abilities<lf>and pick your battles accordingly.
<string>If you don't, you might end up like me,<lf>sitting around like a useless nothing<lf>while monsters draw closer to our gates...
<string>So, <PL>.<lf>You took out Magnamalo?<lf>That hunt's no walk in the park.
<string>...I wonder if I could've<lf>done it myself if I wasn't—
<string>Forgive me. Forget what I said.
<string>Hey, <PL>.<lf>You aren't being reckless<lf>out there, are you?
<string>Take care you don't get hurt... Well,<lf>telling a hunter to hunt unscathed<lf>is asking a little much, I suppose.
<string>But if I'd listened to my own advice,<lf>I'd still be able to hunt all day and<lf>repay my debt to my homeland...
<string>Master Utsushi asked me to<lf>come here to help him train<lf>young, would-be hunters.
<string>But now, I have no right to tell others<lf>how to hunt when I'm wounded<lf>to the point of invalidity myself.
<string>Even so, I simply cannot just sit<lf>here feeling sorry for myself while<lf>the Rampage endangers my home.
<string>It drives me mad, and yet, I can't do<lf>anything thing about it...
<string>Even though I'm injured and forbidden<lf>to hunt, I still get up and put on my<lf>hunting gear every day.
<string>Why? I guess I cannot stomach<lf>the thought of an early retirement.
<string>This wave is led by an<lf>Apex monster, I hear.
<string>And this Apex is not just leading<lf>the herd but also heightening<lf>their collective aggression.
<string>So be careful; I don't want to<lf>see you end up in the same<lf>sorry state I have, or worse.
<string>Everyone was making such a fuss about Hinoa<lf>and this blue monster I thought she had been<lf>attacked. I was even readying my blade.
<string>Turns out no, she was just "resonating."<lf>It's taking a toll on her body, sure, but<lf>there's no...immediate danger, is there?
<string>What does this "resonating" even mean?
<string>Ugh. I've been gone so long,<lf>there's so much I don't know<lf>about this place now.
<string>Minoto came by earlier to show me<lf>her quest list.
<string>Showing me, the useless hunter,<lf>of all people? I thought she was<lf>trying to start a fight.
<string>But then she said she had a quest that<lf>might be great for rehabilitation.
<string>And then showed me whole<lf>list that she thought would<lf>perhaps prove helpful...
<string>It was a lesson I sorely needed—that<lf>the only person who decided my<lf>hunting days are over...was me.
<string>Watching hunters come and go here<lf>is so inspiring. Not to mention Minoto's<lf>continuing words of encouragement.
<string>A broken hunter in full gear sulking<lf>in the corner of the Hub... I suppose<lf>it must be quite obvious.
<string>I cannot control whether I make a full<lf>recovery or not, but maybe I can control<lf>whether I fight again...
<string>About to take on Ibushi? Well,<lf>I'm going to the Stronghold too.
<string>I may not have fully recovered, but<lf>there still might be something I can<lf>do besides rotting away here.
<string>Well done, <PL>.<lf>There's still more to do,<lf>but this is a good first step.
<string>It was certainly a giant leap for me,<lf>finding that I can still be of use even<lf>though my injuries might hinder me.
<string>Smack-dab in the middle of the fray,<lf>Hamon handed me a light bowgun<lf>and said, "Fight them off with this!"
<string>I've always preferred great swords,<lf>so I was initially hesitant, but the<lf>bowgun wasn't so bad in the end.
<string>Despite my yet shaky aim, I see<lf>a ray of hope now—even if it means<lf>starting over from square one.
<string>Before my break from hunting, I preferred<lf>weapons with "umph". Great swords and<lf>hammers, for example.
<string>That's why, when my injury made it<lf>impossible to even lift one, I thought<lf>it was hopeless...
<string>Since trying my hand at fighting with<lf>a light bowgun back at the Stronghold,<lf>I now see how close-minded I was.
<string>There's nothing more shortsighted than<lf>needlessly limiting your own potential.<lf>Time to get to work!
<string>I had convinced myself that I would<lf>never hunt again...
<string>But after watching the display<lf>you put on. How you never gave<lf>up. It inspired me to start again.
<string>And with this newfound inspiration<lf>encouraging me to try something new,<lf>all I see now is a path to recovery.
<string>I cannot thank you enough. All I ask of<lf>you now is for you to return home safely.<lf>I won't return to hunting until then.
<string>I may have hunted for longer than<lf>you have, but you've clearly outpaced<lf>me already in terms of skill.
<string>But mark my words! I WILL close<lf>that gap! Just you wait and see!
<string>I've taken up bowgun practice over in<lf>the Training Area. And I think I might<lf>have potential, if I do say so myself.
<string>And somehow my body hurts less.<lf>I suppose a positive attitude really<lf>can make a difference.
<string>I'm going to get my old hunting edge<lf>back with the light bowgun. It may<lf>take a while, but I know I can do it.
<string>I heard—so, you're finally going to settle<lf>the score.
<string><PL>, you and everyone else<lf>here in Kamura showed me a way out of<lf>my own prison of ineptitude.
<string>Now you're what I aspire to.<lf>So you better come back<lf>safe...or else, OK?
<string>I...I'm floored.<lf>You really are an incredible hunter.
<string>You've honestly inspired me. The way you<lf>hunt—it makes me long to be back out on<lf>the field. I'm already ready to go, dangit!
<string>I'm going to train to be as strong as<lf>possible. One day, I'll be good enough<lf>to hunt alongside you. Get ready for it!
<string>I see you're still solving problems left<lf>and right. You're really something,<lf>you know that?
<string>Well, guess what? I'm getting pretty<lf>good with a bowgun. I might just be<lf>joining you sooner than I thought.
<string>I left Kamura at the age of three<lf>because of my parents' work.
<string>But I never forgot this place; as soon<lf>as I got hurt, the first thing I wanted<lf>to do was come back here.
<string>It's not that I hated where I grew up<lf>or anything, but something about<lf>this village just calls to me.
<string>So, do you mostly hunt solo?<lf>Or do you prefer to go out with<lf>a party?
<string>I know I don't seem like I would, but I<lf>can't help but worry incessantly about<lf>my teammates when I hunt in a group.
<string>I get anxious about making sure they're<lf>adequately healed, or that I'm not in<lf>their way, so, going solo's much easier.
<string>I recognize that as my own problem though.<lf>I think other people appreciate seeing effort<lf>AND enjoyment most of all.
<string>Yomogi the Chef is a little ball of energy.<lf>Her smile makes me want to shell out<lf>for dango even when I'm full.
<string>Then, when I return to the Hub,<lf>I am greeted by Otemai with more<lf>delicious dango. I just can't say no...
<string>I can't keep living like this.<lf>My zenny pouch is getting lighter<lf>while my pants are getting tighter!
<string>I thought Kamura's defenders would<lf>all be hunters, but it turns out<lf>most of them are regular villagers.
<string>Well, I guess you don't have to be<lf>a hunter to protect your home.
<string>Everyone—from the twins, to the chefs,<lf>to the Buddy Plaza crew— all carry<lf>a weapon. It's great, honestly.
<string>I had always assumed Minoto<lf>was cold and overly blunt.
<string>But, in reality, she's like a big sister.<lf>Always looking out for me. She has<lf>such a big heart.
<string>I hear her sister, Hinoa, has a big heart as well.<lf>And an even bigger appetite. I love Bunny<lf>Dango as much as the next person...
<string>But I cannot even begin to fathom how<lf>she is able to fit what she eats into<lf>that tiny frame.
<string>Master Utsushi is so cool and composed.<lf>That is until he opens his mouth or starts<lf>walking with that lumbering gait of his.
<string>But I suppose those traits are what make<lf>him approachable, especially for children.
<string>If he were too perfect, I could see<lf>that actually scaring people off, so...<lf>In that sense, he's perfect as he is.
<string>Master Hamon is making me my<lf>very own custom light bowgun!<lf>I could not be happier.
<string>He asked how I wanted it to look, and I<lf>said I wanted something that would make<lf>monsters flee at the mere sight of it.
<string>...Aaand he came back with a light<lf>bowgun decorated with the same<lf>design as the Toadversaries...
<string>I saw the plans, on which were<lf>scribbled: "For Ayame," and<lf>"shoots ammo from mouth."
<string>It seems like Hamon's definition of<lf>intimidation is a lot different than mine...<lf>Still, I'll treasure it dearly.
<string>This is a tough one...
<string>Hey, <PL>...<lf>Do you, uh, have a moment?
<string>I was just over at the Smithy when they<lf>asked me for new weapon suggestions<lf>based on my experience as a hunter.
<string>I was kind of caught off guard, so I joked<lf>that an egg for a hammer would save any<lf>hunter and their stomach in a pinch.
<string>Then Master Hamon suddenly shouted,<lf>"GENIUS!" And now I think he might<lf>actually be drawing up plans...
<string>I mean, if he's really feeling inspired,<lf>I can't just NOT follow through on my<lf>idea, even if I didn't mean it at all.
<string>I hate to ask, but do you think you could<lf>go get the eggs for him? I'd do it myself,<lf>but, well, you know why I can't go.
<string>I owe you one.
<string>Thanks, <PL>.<lf>I gave Master Hamon the eggs you delivered,<lf>and he was pretty pleased.
<string>I still can't believe it, but he actually<lf>went and made an egg hammer.<lf>An egg hammer...
<string>Apparently some other region already<lf>did it first. Too bad, guess it wasn't<lf>so new and original after all...
<string>But to think that someone else actually had<lf>the same crazy idea... Anyway, if you want<lf>one, you know where to get one now.
<string>This is a tough one...
<string><PL>!<lf>Just the person I wanted to see.
<string>A friend of mine is nearing the end<lf>of their first year as a hunter.
<string>I'd really like to send the kid a weapon<lf>as a celebration present, but I don't<lf>have enough parts to finish it.
<string>I'd get the rest of them if I could,<lf>but my leg still hasn't quite healed<lf>up. So I was wondering...
<string>*sigh* You wouldn't happen to<lf>have any lying around that you<lf>don't mind parting with, would you?
<string>I owe you one.
<string>Can I really have these!?<lf>Ugh, I'm sorry for the trouble.<lf>I owe you big time, seriously.
<string>I'll tell my friend that a hunter from<lf>this village helped get the parts.<lf>They'll be thrilled to hear it!
<string>Speaking of the gift, turns out the smithies<lf>here had never made one before so they<lf>made it based on my instructions.
<string>I'm pretty sure they'll have started forging<lf>'em by the next time you stop by. Check<lf>it out if you're interested!
<string>I'm restless...
