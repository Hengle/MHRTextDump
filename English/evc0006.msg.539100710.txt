<string>Elder, I have important news.
<string>Thank you, Utsushi.
<string>Elder Fugen?
<string>Hinoa, Minoto.
<string>Go assemble the villagers.
<string>We have discovered...the whereabouts<lf>of Thunder Serpent Narwa.
<string>The one Wind Serpent Ibushi calls<lf>his "queen."
<string>If we defeat her, then the Rampage<lf>may finally come to an end!
<string>However, the Hunters dispatched by the<lf>Guild to dispose of Narwa...
<string>Have all been completely wiped out...
<string>Therefore the guild has issued a request<lf>to the Hunter...
<string>who was responsible for defeating Ibushi.
<string>Yes, YOU, Hunter.
<string>So? Think you can handle it?
<string>Heh. Of course!
<string>You havta—havta...
<string>HAVTA come back to us.
<string>Or I'll wipe the FLOOR with what's<lf>left of you!
<string>You're my biggest...
<string>No, the village's biggest hero!
<string>We're all family here.
<string>We're all in this together!
<string>Your courage is an inspiration...
<string>Seeing you face the calamity<lf>has given us so much hope...
<string>Whatever happens while you're out there, never<lf>forget that your family is waiting for you here!
<string>Alright, everyone! Our hunter is about<lf>to face the biggest challenge yet!
<string>Let's all get to work!
