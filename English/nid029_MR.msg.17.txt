<string>Hey, you're going to that Outpost, right?<lf>The one in the Kingdom? You be careful<lf>out there, OK?
<string>If anything happens to you, Komitsu's<lf>gonna cry buckets! And I couldn't bear<lf>to see that.
<string>Uhhh, I mean—!
<string>I, I don't care if she cries!<lf>I just don't want you to get hurt!
<string>I can't get tough if you don't show me<lf>all your killer moves!
<string>And if I don't learn to fight like you,<lf>I won't be able to keep her safe<lf>next time the village is in trouble!
<string>So what's Elgado like, huh? Must be<lf>full of people from the Kingdom...
<string>Y'know, I might leave the village one day,<lf>too. I'm gonna need to know my way<lf>around so I can show Komitsu...
<string>Uhhh, I mean—!
<string>It's n-not like! I-I'm not thinking of taking<lf>a trip with her! No way!
<string>But she's always going on about leaving<lf>the village and it's dangerous out<lf>there, so, you know, I kinda have to...
<string>You know, since you left the village,<lf>Komitsu's really sad sometimes.
<string>I don't get it. I'M still here! But I can't<lf>seem to cheer her up. I dunno what<lf>to say to her...
<string>She really likes you, y'know?<lf>And I'm not you...
<string>But...but that's just now! One day, I'm<lf>gonna be way tougher and cooler than<lf>you and then *I* can make her feel better.
<string>Just...not right now. So don't stay away<lf>too long, OK? Come back often and<lf>show your face.
<string>Komitsu was going on and on about you<lf>again the other day, wondering if you were<lf>OK or not.
<string>And I just blurted out that her worrying<lf>wasn't gonna make any difference to you<lf>at all.
<string>What I meant was, you're so strong,<lf>she doesn't NEED to worry about you<lf>because you'll totally be OK!
<string>She just nodded at what I said, but...<lf>Argh! I should've comforted her!<lf>I should've been, like, a gentleman!
<string>Haah...I'm hopeless, <PL>.<lf>Anyway, forget about me. But would<lf>you go see Komitsu and cheer her up?
<string><VO:SER>Hey! <PL>!<lf>What, you're better already!?
<string><VO:NOR>...Huh? It wasn't you who got hurt?<lf>I knew it! Mom's always gettin' stuff<lf>like this wrong!
<string>I thought you'd been injured and I was<lf>trying really hard not to tell Komitsu.
<string>Uhhh, I mean—!
<string>It's n-not like that! I-I...I just didn't want<lf>her to cry because it's a pain for Hinoa<lf>and stuff...
<string>All the grown-ups are so busy, they<lf>don't need that. It's better if Komitsu<lf>and me just talk about fun stuff.
<string>Sounds like you're doing a lot of cool<lf>stuff over in Elgado!
<string>Master Utsushi told me all about it.<lf>Komitsu heard, too, and she was like,<lf>"<PL> is sooooo cool!"
<string>I guess it makes me happy, too.<lf>I mean, when I see Komitsu smile,<lf>I just can't help smiling as well.
<string>Uhhh, I mean—!
<string>I don't care if she smiles her teeth out!<lf>It's just really cool that you're making<lf>Kamura look so great, that's all!
<string>That means more visitors and more people<lf>to sell rice balls and candy apples to!<lf>That'll bring a smile to her face, too!
<string>Hey, <PL>, welcome home.<lf>Hinoa said your work over in the Outpost<lf>is coming to an end.
<string>Does that mean you'll be coming back<lf>here for good? Komitsu would be over<lf>the moon.
<string>I mean, sure, that'd be great news,<lf>but wouldn't it have been better to be<lf>here the whole time? Y'know, like...me?
<string>Uhhh, I mean—!
<string>I-It's n-not like I spend my days trying<lf>to make her happy! No way!
<string>I'-I'm, uh, just happy that she's happy,<lf>y'know? Whatever makes her smile<lf>is OK by me!
<string>So, Tsuriki always comes by and buys<lf>a few rice balls from my stand...
<string>And every time, Mom gives him a stack of<lf>vegetables. I don't get it. He comes for<lf>rice balls, and goes home with all that!
<string>She's always like, "Make sure you eat<lf>plenty of greens!" It's like she thinks<lf>he's a kid or something...
<string>Y'know, she's always worrying about you,<lf>too, <PL>. So you better eat<lf>your greens too! Haha!
<string>That Rondine lady is a knight, right?<lf>I dunno... If you ask me, she just looks<lf>like a regular ol' merchant.
<string>Are knights like hunters for the Kingdom,<lf>or something? I mean, she looks really<lf>strong.
<string>Komitsu said she thought Rondine<lf>was really awesome. She sure is<lf>crazy about hunters...
<string>Hmph! I won't be selling rice balls forever,<lf>y'know! One day, I'll be as tough as a<lf>hunter! Then she'll think I'M awesome!
<string>Uhhh, I mean—!
<string>I-I don't care WHO she thinks is awesome.<lf>I, uh, just don't want anyone to think I'm<lf>second best, that's all!
<string>Guess what Mom said to me...? She<lf>told me to stop teasing Komitsu so<lf>much and be nicer to her.
<string>I know I should. I just kinda blurt stuff<lf>out. I can't help it... I don't want to be<lf>mean her... I like her, so...
<string>Uhhh, I mean—!
<string>I-I don't "LIKE HER," like her. No way!<lf>It's just...
<string>No one could NOT like Komitsu! Right?<lf>I mean, she's just so nice! And so clever!<lf>And so pretty, and— *ahem*
<string>So yeah, of course I "LIKE" her.<lf>Who wouldn't? Pfft.
<string>I thought I was gonna get tough and<lf>strong while you were away, but...<lf>It just hasn't happened.
<string>You really are awesome, y'know?<lf>Can you, like, maybe gimme some<lf>lessons sometime, <PL>?
<string>What, is that funny or something?<lf>Yeah, OK, maybe before I didn't<lf>wanna be taught by you, but...
<string>But it's stupid for me to have that<lf>attitude. I just need to get tough fast!<lf>So I can protect her if I have to!
<string>So please say yes! When you're back<lf>in the village, promise you'll show me<lf>everything you know!
<string>Hey, <PL>...<lf>Are you ever...like, scared when you're<lf>hunting monsters?
<string>Lately, I've been taking archery lessons<lf>from Hinoa, but so far, all I've done is<lf>target practice with the Toadversary...
<string>And that's more than enough for me!<lf>If I was up against a real monster<lf>then I'd—
<string>...Wh-What!? Me scared!? N-No way!<lf>I was just wondering if YOU get scared,<lf>that's all!
<string>I mean, it's way more scary thinking<lf>what could happen to Komitsu if I was<lf>frozen with fear, unable to shoot!
<string>Check it out! Master Hamon gave me<lf>my very own bow! It's way cooler than the<lf>hand-me-down Hinoa was letting me use.
<string>Even though it's just a kids' bow, it's still<lf>WAY better and a lot stronger than that<lf>junk I was using before!
<string>And if I keep practicing then I'll get<lf>stronger and I'll be able to keep<lf>Komitsu safe. Then she'll—
<string>Uhhh, I mean—!
<string>Agh, I can't tell her how I feel!<lf>I mean, that I'd die to keep her safe!<lf>Argh! Feelings are so stupid!
