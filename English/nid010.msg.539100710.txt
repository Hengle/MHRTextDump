<string>Hey, <PL>!<lf>Do you want a candy apple?<lf>They're really sweet and yummy!
<string>You're out shopping with Hinoa right now?<lf>Oh, sorry! Come back anytime!
<string>Are you a real hunter now, <PL>?<lf>You are!? WOW! Congratumalations!
<string>These candy apples are super<lf>yummy, but they won't help<lf>you hunt better or anything...
<string>But, I get so many more customers<lf>when you come say hi to me,<lf><PL>!
<string>I bet you have some sort of<lf>special power that helps<lf>bring in customers 'n stuff!
<string>So come to talk to me a lot PLEEEEEASE!<lf>That'd be nice.
<string><VO:SER>Seihaku always says mean things to me.
<string>Everyone says he only does<lf>it because he likes me.
<string>But, why is he mean if he likes me?
<string>I like you and Hinoa and everyone else,<lf>but I'm not a meanie like him.
<string>I just don't get boys.
<string>I'm not gonna let some dumb<lf>Rampage bring me down.
<string>I have a really, really important<lf>mission: protecting the candy<lf>apple store!
<string>Elder Fugen and Miss Hinoa gave<lf>it to me, so it's really important!<lf>Isn't that so cool!?
<string>They said it's also my mission<lf>to "run away as fast as I can<lf>if someone tells me to run."
<string>So, I'm practicing running a lot.<lf>That way I can run away super<lf>fast if I need to!
<string>Yomogi always comes by to coach<lf>me in being a "successful salesperson."
<string>I wanna be just like Yomogi one day!<lf>She always makes her customers smile!
<string><VO:SER>Hey, <PL>...?<lf>Th-There aren't really ghosts in<lf>the Shrine Ruins, are there?
<string>I heard some merchants in Yomogi's<lf>Tea Shop say there were.
<string>I'm not scared of monsters 'cause you'd<lf>get 'em for me, b-but ghosts...
<string>When I have leftover apples,<lf>I take them to the Buddy Plaza.
<string>All the Buddies there really<lf>like them. It makes me happy<lf>seeing the Buddies enjoy them!
<string>I wish they could try the candy<lf>ones, but I know they're too hard<lf>for Buddies to bite into. Oh, well...
<string><VO:SER>Hey, <PL>...?<lf>Th-There aren't really ghosts in<lf>the Shrine Ruins, are there?
<string>I heard some merchants in Yomogi's<lf>Tea Shop say there were.
<string>I'm not scared of monsters 'cause you'd<lf>get 'em for me, b-but ghosts...
<string>Hey, <PL>, are you<lf>gonna go beat the Rampage?
<string>I can't go. Elder Fugen says,<lf>"Everyone besides the defenders<lf>has got to stay at home."
<string>But, everyone's coming back, right?<lf>Everyone's gonna be OK, right...?
<string>Are you OK, <PL>? People said<lf>you got chased by some big scary monster<lf>called Magnamalo.
<string>Yomogi said the ghost at the Ruins<lf>wasn't really a ghost, but Magnamalo!
<string>I'm kinda glad there's no ghosts, but<lf>Magnamalo is really scary too...
<string>Did you hear that Mr. Hamon made<lf>something that'll beat Magnamalo?
<string>I helped carry it to the Stronghold.<lf>We worked really, really hard, too—<lf>it was soooooo heavy!
<string>Mr. Hamon said, "If we beat that Magnamalo,<lf>it'll be thanks to you."
<string>I was so happy!<lf>It's nice to be helpful.
<string><PL>, are you gonna go<lf>beat Magnamalo?
<string>I gotta stay here...but, I'm gonna cheer for you<lf>starting now, OK?
<string>You can do it, <PL>!<lf>You can do it, <PL>!<lf>You can do it, WOOOOOO!
<string>How was that?<lf>Are you super-duper pumped now!?
<string>You're always ready to help<lf>solve everybody's problems.<lf>You're amazing!
<string>You know, <PL>,<lf>Yomogi and Iori both said<lf>they really like you.
<string>I like you too, 'cause whenever I talk to you,<lf>I always wanna smile.
<string>You're always ready to help<lf>solve everybody's problems.<lf>You're amazing!
<string>You know, <PL>,<lf>Yomogi and Iori both said<lf>they really like you.
<string>I like you too, 'cause whenever I talk to you,<lf>I always wanna smile.
<string>This stranger came by the other day and said,<lf>"How can you all be smiling with the Rampage<lf>at our door!?"
<string>And I was like,<lf>"Because <PL> is here, duh!"
<string>"We have a hunter who's really cool and<lf>strong, and nice, and helps everyone."
<string>Then Elder Fugen was like, "Attagirl, she<lf>knows what she's talking about!" Then the<lf>stranger bought a ton of candy apples!
<string>Look, you made me smile again.<lf>Thank you! Tee hee hee!
<string>The candy apple store sign was made<lf>by Minoto from the Gathering Hub.
<string>I went there to ask Mr. Hojo<lf>at first, because he's good at<lf>drawing, but he wasn't there, so...
<string>I was like, oh what should I do, but<lf>then Minoto said she'd do it.<lf>And she worked on it all night!
<string>Some people say she looks scary,<lf>but she's SO nice. I like her a lot!

<string>Some people say she looks scary,<lf>but she's SO nice. I like her a lot!
<string>I heard an "Apex" monster showed up.
<string>...I don't know what an Apex is,<lf>but it sounds really scary.
<string>I'm super glad Hinoa's better!<lf>'Cause she didn't look so good after<lf>she came back from fighting...
<string><VO:SER>But now, Minoto's looking really down.<lf>She's like, looking sad and saying, "I was<lf>useless," and stuff like that...
<string>I don't get it, though. Minoto did all<lf>she could do. Why's she so sad?<lf>Grownups are so weird...
<string>Everyone's looking for that blue monster<lf>because it's the reason why Hinoa was<lf>looking so sad.
<string>I'm gonna keep an eye on the sky too<lf>and tell Mr. Hojo as soon as I see<lf>a blue monster!
<string>Everyone said that if we beat the blue monster,<lf>the Rampage will go away forever.
<string>They tried to explain it to me, but it was<lf>really hard to understand...
<string>But, I mean, if it hurt Hinoa it's a bad<lf>monster, right? So we gotta teach it<lf>a lesson!
<string>I heard the blue monster was found.<lf>Are you gonna beat it at the next<lf>Rampage fight?
<string>I'm gonna be good and stay home<lf>until everyone comes back.<lf>Good luck, <PL>!
<string>So the blue monster got away? Maybe it<lf>got scared of you because you're so strong!
<string>But Elder Fugen said to "stay veggy-lunt."<lf>Does that mean it'll come back?
<string>Everyone said the blue monster's "partner"<lf>showed up. What does that mean? "Partner"?<lf>Is it the blue monster's friend?
<string>Then they said it might be a lot stronger<lf>than the blue one.
<string>A friend stronger than the blue one?<lf>I wonder what color it is.
<string>I know Narwa is really scary from<lf>the stories Miss Hinoa and Miss<lf>Minoto told me about it.
<string>I'm really worried because you have to go fight<lf>it. I mean, I know everyone thinks you can beat<lf>it...but I don't want to see you get hurt!
<string>If I could watch you fight, I would cheer<lf>you on. But you'll just have to imagine<lf>me doing it here. Sorry...
<string>It's still not completely peaceful in Kamura,<lf>but you're here, so I know we'll be OK.
<string>I'm gonna work hard and make more<lf>candy apples like I always do, so<lf>more people can buy them.
<string>When I hear that you're going to go hunt<lf>a scary monster, I cheer you on in my mind.<lf>Like, "You can do it! YOU CAN DO IT!"
<string>And when you come back safe<lf>and smile at me...
<string>I go back to making candy apples. I bet<lf>the Rampage will end if I keep it up!

<string>Have you heard yet, <PL>?<lf>We're gonna have a big welcome-back<lf>party for you later!
<string>And I'm even making the candy<lf>apples for it too, hee hee!
<string>I'm...actually kinda worried, but... But<lf>I'll keep cheering you on while I'm making<lf>a whole huge bunch of my apples.
<string>And I'll have the biiiggest candy apple<lf>you ever saw ready for when you're back!
<string>So the Rampage is going away, right?<lf>Because you beat the scary monsters?
<string>Hinoa said now we can have a whole<lf>bunch of people visit us from outside<lf>the village again!
<string>And Yomogi says she's working<lf>on some new Bunny Dango!<lf>I can't wait to try 'em!
<string>And it's all thanks you, <PL>.<lf>Thank you so, so much!
<string>The village is so full of people now,<lf>and it's all thanks to you, <PL>!<lf>Thank you! Hee hee!
<string>Now I have all the energy I need to make<lf>candy apples so yummy, everyone's gonna love<lf>them!
<string>What about the people who already love<lf>them? Like you, <PL>? Well, um...<lf>I hope they love them even more!

<string>Seihaku still says mean things to me,<lf>but sometimes he gives me rice balls.
<string>He never takes no for an answer,<lf>so I give him candy apples for them.
<string>Do you think that's fair? Seihaku<lf>doesn't say anything when I give<lf>them to him, so I don't know!

<string>Sometimes Seihaku is nice<lf>and sometimes he's mean.<lf>I don't know why, so I asked.
<string>I said, "Seihaku, do you like me?<lf>Or do you hate me?"
<string>Then, Seihaku turned all red and<lf>ran away, screaming, "AHHHHHH!"
<string>*sigh* I just don't get boys.

<string>Bunny Dango taste better<lf>if you eat 'em with friends.<lf>It's the best!
<string>A little bit of sugar and a little bit<lf>of spice. That's the stuff!
<string>I hope <PL> will like it...
<string><PL>, can I give you something...?
<string>I practiced real hard to say the name right:<lf>it's a <COLS RED>Garb of Glad Tidings</COL>! You put it on<lf>your Cohoot, and it brings you good luck!
<string>And on top of that, I wished looots<lf>and loooooots of extra glad tidings<lf>into it for you, <PL>.
<string>I really hope they come true,<lf>and you get a whole bunch<lf>of good luck 'cause of it!

<string>Um, can I ask you something?
<string>Oh oh oh! <PL>!<lf>You ever hear of a <COLS RED>Bombadgy</COL>? They're<lf>so pudgy and cute, I wanna hug one!
<string>They're my favorite. When they start<lf>pooting out gas, they sound like<lf>a leaky balloon, and I just LOSE it!
<string>But Seihaku doesn't get it—he says<lf>they're ugly! I think it's 'cuz he's never<lf>seen them when they're all gassy.
<string>Um, could you please take a picture<lf>of a Bombadgy letting out gas?
<string>I bet Seihaku'll think they're cute<lf>once he sees one do it!
<string>Yaaay!
<string>Thank you so much, <PL>!<lf>You ARE the bestest!
<string>Hehehehe.<lf>Look at it, isn't it so funny and cute!?<lf>They're the best!
<string>I bet Seihaku'll think they're cute<lf>once I show him this.
<string>Oh! By the way, I was talking to Hamon<lf>and Nakago at the Smithy about how<lf>Bombagy are super cool and all…
<string>Then they showed me a really big<lf>hunting horn made from one!
<string>You should go see it! It's so cute<lf>and you'd be the coolest hunter<lf>ever if you used it!
<string>Um, can I ask you something?
<string>Have you ever heard of<lf><COLS RED>Arzuros</COL>?
<string>Yomogi told me that they look<lf>funny when they're sleeping.
<string>I wanna see one!<lf>I bet they are super cute!
<string>Do you think you could take a picture<lf>of a sleeping <COL RED>Arzuros</COL> for me, please?<lf>You'd be the bestest if you did!
<string>Yaaay!
<string>You really brought the picture<lf>for me? Oh, thank you! You really<lf>ARE the bestest!
<string>Wooow. I always thought Arzuros<lf>were scary, but in this picture,<lf>it looks too fluffy to be scary.
<string>Thanks so much for the nice photo,<lf><PL>!
<string>Oh, by the way! I heard Mister Hamon<lf>and Mister Nakago made a huge weapon<lf>that looks like a big, fluffy bear!
<string>I told them that I wanted one,<lf>but they said I'm not old enough yet...
<string>Hey, if you wanna see it too,<lf>you should go see them!
