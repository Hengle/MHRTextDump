<string>I've heard the talk about you.
<string>Word is, you're a real hotshot, but I think<lf>they might've misplaced a vowel! Bwaha—<lf>*ahem* How's 'bout a little test, Scrawny?
<string>All you gotta do is go and get me a monster<lf>egg—there's that ugly face again! Oh, that's<lf>your normal face? Bwaha— *ahem*
<string>Look, Scrawny. I'll make it worth your while.<lf>In return, I'll tell ya how to upgrade an egg-<lf>cellent weapon. Get it? Bwaha— *ahem*
<string>...What? You want me to go with you? Pfft!<lf>Sorry, pal, but it's dango time for me and<lf>a solo egg-sperience for you! Bwahaha!
<string>There might be something to<lf>those rumors after all...
<string>Sounds like I've got a major omelet in<lf>my future. Good work, Scrawny. Maybe<lf>I owe you some respect. Nope! Bwahaha!
<string>*ahem* Anyway, I already told that pretty<lf>redhead over at the Smithy how to upgrade<lf>that weapon. See? I'm a man of my word!
<string>Now if you don't mind, we gotta get back<lf>to keepin' Elgado safe. But first, more<lf>dango! Bwahaha!
<string>Hmmmm. Standin' before the Hell Hunters<lf>without breakin' a sweat, huh? Impressive...
<string>You're the one the Order has been<lf>harpin' on about? Those royal dorks<lf>love their harpin'.
<string>Pfft. Just a big Plesioth in a small pond.<lf>Well, you're in my waters now, Scrawny.<lf>And you ain't nothing but a small fry to me!
<string>And I'll make chum out of ya, if you get in<lf>our way! We'll keep Elgado safe, go dangle<lf>on a hook somewhere else! Bwahaha!
<string>Here we go again! Stuck here while my<lf>bro is waitin' on his dango. This is gonna<lf>take a while.
<string>Sorry to disappoint ya, Scrawny, but you're<lf>gonna have to wait if you wanna see some<lf>REAL hunters in action.
<string>Just think of it as saving the best for last.<lf>You go handle those little hors d'oeuvres!<lf>We'll handle the main course! Bwahaha!
<string>You must be smokin' that Felvine if you<lf>think we came all the way here for these<lf>little dinky quests! Psh...
<string>Well, Scrawny. The only smashin' you're<lf>gonna see today, is my bro smashin'<lf>that plate of dango! Bwahahaha!
<string>You're back, huh? I thought you ran<lf>home to your mommy after seein'<lf>what REAL hunters look like.
<string>Well, I hope you trained real hard because<lf>the monsters here aren't like those cute li'l<lf>teddybear monsters you got back home.
<string>I don't care what you think you know<lf>about huntin' or what Princess Four<lf>Eyes told ya, Scrawny...
<string>Until you've racked up the kind of huntin'<lf>hours we've got, you're only gonna go out<lf>there and get stomped flat.
<string>Hey, it's not like I care if you get hurt<lf>or not, I just don't want your Scrawny<lf>carcass stinkin' up the cart. Bwahaha!
<string>So let me get this straight. The Admiral<lf>specifically asked for you? By name<lf>and everything? Bwahaha!
<string>What a bunch of baloney! Next thing<lf>you'll be tellin' me is you're some kind<lf>of big shot hero that saved your village!
<string>Off to hunt a Blood Orange Bishaten, eh?<lf>Ha! We were monkeyin' around in that ape's<lf>business while you were still in diapers!
<string>Well, you can have that chimp, chump!<lf>We came to hunt monsters, not to have<lf>a dung flingin' contest! Bwahaha!
<string>So, you found some monster tracks huh?<lf>BIG DEAL! You know what else you'll<lf>find if you follow behind a monster?
<string>Well, if you ain't figured it out yet, I ain't<lf>gonna spell it out for ya. My bro's over<lf>here eatin'! Bwahaha!
<string>Bwahaha! That's a first! A simple rescue<lf>mission dressed up as an urgent quest!<lf>They'll have you pickin' mushrooms next!
<string>We'll leave the grunt work to you! Who<lf>knows when a real threat will pop up? Ninety<lf>percent of hunting is waitin'—Ninety-nine!
<string>Well, look who it is! We were JUST<lf>wonderin' if you'd gone out there and got<lf>lost yourself! Well, glad you're back.
<string>...Don't get the wrong idea, Scrawny.<lf>I just didn't wanna have to go out and<lf>look for ya! Bwahahaha!
<string>A Garangolm!? Pfft. That pile of rocks<lf>is as harmless as, well, a pile of rocks!
<string>Man... When's a REAL monster gonna<lf>come along? I feel like all I do is sit<lf>here and watch my bro eat dango...
<string>What's this garbage? Support Surveys!?<lf>The Hell Hunters don't do escort quests,<lf>ya hear!?
<string>I know all you pathetic hunters wanna feel<lf>safe and cozy out in the field, but the Hell<lf>Hunters aren't babysitters!
<string>Right, Bro? Jeez, what's next? You want<lf>us to tuck you in and kiss you goodnight,<lf>too? Bwahaha!
<string>So someone from the Order thought they<lf>saw some li'l creatures buzzin' around and<lf>now y'all are gonna try to catch some?
<string>Sounds like someone got hit on the head<lf>one too many times. Well, let me know if<lf>you find anything. Not crossin' my fingers.
<string>So these little peons are what everybody's<lf>been worryin' about? Well, they should<lf>be worried...
<string>Worried about how ugly they are! Barf!<lf>Hey! They're almost as ugly as you,<lf>Scrawny! Bwahahaha!
<string>An urgent quest!? To do what? Teach<lf>that dumb puppy some new tricks!?<lf>Psh...
<string>That Lunagaron's lucky I don't go out<lf>there; I got a trick to teach it. Roll over<lf>and play dead! Bwahaha!
<string>I bet those research dweebs wet their<lf>pants when Malzeno showed up! What<lf>a bunch of losers! Bwahaha!
<string>Now that's a monster I'd like to get<lf>a piece of! It's lucky me and my bro<lf>were stuck here keeping Elgado safe...
<string>But that's OK, its day with the mighty<lf>Hell Hunters will come! Just need to<lf>wait for my bro to finish his dango...
<string>So one little love tap from Malzeno and the<lf>broad from the Order gets laid up in bed?<lf>Maybe if she wore more than a chest plate...
<string>Well, you let her know, she can rest all she<lf>needs! The mighty Hell Hunters are here<lf>and nothing's gonna happen on our watch!
<string>I admire your hustle, Scrawny! Those<lf>research quests are easy zenny!<lf>Milk 'em for everything they got!
<string>If those research dweebs start catchin'<lf>on, just give me a piece of the action<lf>and I won't say nothin'! Bwahaha!
<string>Sounds like that dame from the Order<lf>is finally back on her feet. She's got<lf>some guts after all!
<string>And now y'all are shippin' off to fight<lf>Malzeno? Bwahaha! Crazy! Let's see<lf>if round two goes any better!
<string>If things take a turn, don't worry! Me<lf>and my bro will swoop in to save you!
<string>Right, Bro!? ......RIGHT!? Hello?<lf>Can you hear me? Just how much<lf>longer you gonna keep eatin'!?
<string>So you went behind our backs and stole<lf>our hunt, did ya? Normally, I'd be pretty<lf>upset, but I guess you did us a favor...
<string>I mean, if a pathetic scrub like you could<lf>take down Malzeno, then it wasn't even<lf>worth our time in the first place!
<string>Heh, I can't believe I'm sayin' this, but<lf>you might end up bein' useful after all,<lf>Scrawny! Bwahaha!
<string>Even with Malzeno gone, we still have<lf>to see that ugly face? ...No, not you,<lf>Scrawny! I'm talkin' 'bout the Qurio!
<string>Man! Those things are ugly! They make<lf>a Khezu look like a prom queen! Ugh,<lf>I lost my appetite just thinkin' about 'em!
<string>You go out and mop 'em up! I don't<lf>want to be anywhere near their ugly<lf>face or YOURS! Bwahaha!
<string>They still got you chasin' around those<lf>Qurio? What a sucker!
<string>Well, not everyone can be a hero... Some<lf>of us are destined for greatness and you're<lf>destined to do grunt work! Bwahaha!
<string>Finally! A monster worthy of the mighty<lf>Hell Hunters! But the timin' just couldn't<lf>be worse...
<string>We just ordered the ultimate gear from<lf>the Smithy right before—literally right<lf>before—we heard the news.
<string>Sorry, we're not leavin' until it's done.<lf>You hear me!? The ultimate hunters<lf>need ultimate gear!
<string>I don't care if the quest is urgent or<lf>extreme or WHATEVER! My mind is<lf>focused tight on that sweet new gear!
<string>So the Qurio lasted to the end, did they?<lf>Who saw that coming?
<string>That's how they get you, you know?<lf>The sneaky ones. You gotta watch<lf>out for 'em!
<string>Well, I guess that means we're sticking<lf>around! Can't count on those research<lf>dweebs to keep this place safe! Bwahaha!
<string>Hey, Bro. I don't want a repeat of last<lf>time, OK? You ate so much you couldn't<lf>stand up! Pfft!
<string>Or maybe you wanna give Scrawny<lf>here all the crappy quests! Bwahaha!<lf>I can get behind that!
<string>What's with the look on your ugly mug?<lf>Why are you so hard up to see us hunt?<lf>You tryin' to copy our style or something?
<string>Well, good luck! Pfft. I could tell you<lf>every secret I know and you'll still be<lf>the biggest scrub that ever did scrub!
<string>If you got time to stand there and soak up<lf>our rugged manliness, you got time to go<lf>out and get some of those quests done!
<string>...Huh? What about us? WHAT ABOUT US!?<lf>You see any monsters in Elgado gobblin'<lf>up Felynes or Princesses? No!?
<string>You're welcome! See, we're here to keep<lf>Elgado safe, and you're here to... Well,<lf>I'm not sure why you're here.
<string>But I know it ain't to keep botherin' me<lf>and my bro. Now get out of my face!<lf>Bwahaha!
<string>Looks like we might've been wrong about<lf>you, Scrawny. So we've gone and decided<lf>to give you a new name. *ahem*
<string>"The Hunter Formerly Known As Scrawny".<lf>Yeah? Yeah? I knew you'd like it! We'll<lf>keep it "Scrawny" for short. Bwahaha!
<string>Princess Four Eyes over there might<lf>be small in stature, but she's big in spirit.
<string>She's already standin' there when we sit<lf>down for our mornin' dango. And then<lf>stands there all day, too!
<string>That's resolve for you! That's heart!<lf>That's a powerful pair of legs! Wasted<lf>on clerical work!
<string>With a little trainin', I bet she could be<lf>a pretty good hunter. Definitely better<lf>than you, Scrawny! Bwahaha!
<string>So this pretty lady from your village<lf>came by the other day and ordered<lf>a whole pile of dango.
<string>She then proceeded to utterly destroy<lf>my bro in an eatin' contest! Said she<lf>needed the energy to go huntin'...!
<string>Man! If she can hunt anywhere near as<lf>good as she can eat, we might all be<lf>out of job, Scrawny! Bwahaha!
<string>So ya survived out here this long, Scrawny.<lf>You might just make it as a real hunter.<lf>...One day! Bwahaha!
