<string>How did it go?
<string>Ah! Took care of it, didja?
<string>Good work!
<string>VERY good work, Hunter!
<string>Hinoa...?
<string>I can no longer sense its presence.
<string>Ibushi must have...<lf>flown off somewhere distant.
<string>I want to say this is the end of<lf>the Rampage, but...
<string>Something's still bothering me...
<string>We still don't know why Ibushi<lf>showed up.
<string>All we know is that it's looking for<lf>its "queen."
<string>That mystery remains to be solved...
<string>Hinoa, Minoto.
<string>Tell everyone in the village that we're<lf>not out of the clear yet.
<string>Understood, Elder Fugen.
