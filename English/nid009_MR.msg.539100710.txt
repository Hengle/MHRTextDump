<string>How's it goin'? What's on the agenda<lf>for today?
<string>Say what? You're heading to the Kingdom's<lf>outpost to start an investigation!?
<string>I guess tales of the famed "Savior of<lf>Kamura" have reached the Kingdom's<lf>ears. You should be proud!
<string>Wait a minute, if the Kingdom needs your<lf>help...then it must be something big!
<string>You know, I never knew how strong our<lf>Courier kitty, Senri was until the other day<lf>he was like, "Check out these bad boys!"
<string>He flexed his furry little arm, and I dung<lf>you not, his little meowscles—eh, muscles<lf>were as hard as a Basarios's behind!
<string>I guess being a Courier keeps you<lf>in pretty good shape. Not about<lf>to change careers though!
<string>When I heard about all these monsters<lf>invading from the Kingdom, I was honestly<lf>pretty worried...
<string>But then I thought, if you could keep us<lf>safe from the Rampage, you can keep<lf>us safe from these invading monsters.
<string>Don't forget to pay us a visit every now<lf>and again so we know you're doing OK.<lf>Or else people'll start worrying about ya!
<string>Of course, everyone knows that you're<lf>a superstar hunter, but we still worry<lf>about you... Be careful, OK?
<string>Master Hamon is incredible! He's already<lf>started making equipment from those<lf>Kingdom monsters!
<string>And this is premium stuff! I mean, sure<lf>everything Master Hamon makes is top<lf>notch, but this...
<string>This stuff is next-level! What I wouldn't<lf>give to get my hands on some of it, but<lf>there's no way I can get those materials...
<string>The other day Mihaba said he was gonna<lf>go fishing with Kajika, and started taking<lf>his clothes off right in the middle of town!
<string>I was like, what are you doing, man!?<lf>He had been drinking so I refused to<lf>let him go.
<string>He was so wasted he would have ended<lf>up sleepin' with the fish...
<string>Kajika looked so confused. He asked,<lf>what's wrong with taking off your clothes<lf>in front of everyone...? Hmph. Felynes...
<string>Welcome back hunter, looking as capable<lf>as ever, I see. I heard you've been takin'<lf>care of business in the Kingdom.
<string>So how 'bout it? You think you're the best<lf>hunter on the continent yet? Haha!
<string>I sure could learn a thing or two from ya.<lf>I should probably get my rear in gear and<lf>get out there myself, but I'm so lazy...
