<string>Hey, <PL>!<lf>I hear you're leaving us...
<string>Will wonders never cease? Can't say<lf>you won't be missed, but you gotta<lf>do what you gotta do, am I right?
<string>Best of luck out there!<lf>We'll be cheering for you!
<string>Don't forget about us, meow! Come back<lf>and visit when you can! You know you're<lf>welcome back anytime!
<string>Tending to the Toadversary is one<lf>of my many duties as su-purr-visor<lf>of this Plaza.
<string>While the responsibility lies square on<lf>my shoulders, Rondine came by the<lf>other day and lent me a paw.
<string>I didn't want her purr-ety uniform to<lf>get dirty, but she said, "Knights are<lf>not concerned with such things."
<string>That lady's cool as a mew-cumber!<lf>I can see why Chino and Kotori hold<lf>her in such high esteem!
<string>I want to show my ap-purr-eciation<lf>somehow! I oughta ask those two<lf>how I can repay her.
<string>Kogarashi told us a bit about the work<lf>you've been up to, <PL>.
<string>He used a lotta big words that went over<lf>my head, but one thing's fur sure: them's<lf>some scary meownsters you're hunting!
<string>Mew, makes my fur stand on end just<lf>thinking about it!
<string>Mew wee, you're something else!<lf>Standing up to all those fur-eaky<lf>meownsters out there in the wilds!
<string>Keeping the Buddy Plaza spic and<lf>span is just another duty falling to<lf>the Buddy Expert.
<string>Whenever I bust out the elbow grease,<lf>though, Iori is right there next to me,<lf>cleaning up a storm.
<string>I tell him it's my job, but he always<lf>says, "two paws are better than one."
<string>And he's no slouch when it comes to<lf>a scrub brush! With him around, the<lf>job's done before mew know it.
<string>That's why I gotta return the favor,<lf>and help meow-t my scrubbing buddy<lf>any way I can!
<string>I went to hang meow-t with Sekirei in the<lf>Arena the other day.
<string>Meowster Utsushi was practicing a<lf>new impression, and let out a fur-some<lf>roar!
<string>It litter-ally made my fur stand on end!<lf>It was like someone sent lightning<lf>coursing through my entire body!
<string>Is that a Kingdom meownster, I thought!?<lf>Ugh, just thinking about it gets my little<lf>knees knocking, no kitten.
<string>Tell me all about your hunts<lf>in Elgado, <PL>!
<string>I know, I know, tails of meownsters put me<lf>on edge...
<string>Even still, I love hearing your stories.<lf>I purr-omise I won't run away or hide<lf>this time...
<string>B-But, um, maybe leave out the really<lf>scary meownsters, OK? Just tell me<lf>about the fun or silly ones!
