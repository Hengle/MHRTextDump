<string>Meowllo, <PL>!<lf>Off to that meowtpost in the Kingdom?
<string>Do you know where this outpost is,<lf>purr-chance? What? By the sea!?<lf>BY THE SEA!?
<string>Do you know what's in the sea!? FISH!<lf>Of course, our rivers are full of fish, but<lf>sea fish are the cat's meow!
<string>All fish are good, but sea fish have<lf>all those purr-etty colors! And some<lf>of them are MEOW-SIVE!
<string>Make sure you eat as much fish as<lf>you can when you get to the Meowtpost!<lf>It's really good fur you!
<string>Rondine is so cool when she stands<lf>at attention like she does. Such<lf>good pawsture...
<string>Must be the whitefish she eats! It's a low-<lf>fat source of purr-otein and keeps your<lf>bones strong! It's a really mewtritious fish!
<string>So, <PL>, you wanna buy<lf>some? Trust me, you won't regret it!
<string>I hope I can take a trip to the Meowtpost<lf>sometime soon. First thing I'm gonna do<lf>is dive into the sea, whiskers first!
<string>But I gotta be careful, I might get<lf>swept meow-t to sea if the current<lf>is too strong...
<string>That's why I never wear clothes when<lf>I go swimming. They just weigh you<lf>down...
<string>Anymew, let's meet up and go fishing<lf>when I visit! Oh, and you'll have to<lf>show me around too!
<string>The other day, I got a delivery of fish<lf>fur-om Tsuriki's father.
<string>It was so good. The fat just melted<lf>in my meowth... I've never tasted<lf>anything like it!
<string>Ever since then, I've been feeling<lf>a lot healthier!
<string>That fish must've been packed to the<lf>gills with mew-trition. Just thinking<lf>about it makes me hungry...
<string>Welcome back, <PL>!<lf>How are things at the Meowtpost?<lf>I hope you're eating enough fish!
<string>A lack of fish in your diet is no good<lf>at all! A good hunt starts with a good<lf>meal, and a good meal means fish.
<string>You have to be careful what you eat,<lf><PL>. Especially if you're<lf>meow-t in the field!
<string>So, c'mon and buy some fish! Trust<lf>me, you won't regret it! Taste and<lf>fur-eshness guaranteed!
<string>Kagero must be sweating his tail off<lf>wearing that getup!
<string>There's no way he can catch fish in that.<lf>As soon as he jumped in the river, he'd<lf>drop right to the bottom.
<string>You're wearing quite a few layers<lf>yourself, <PL>. How about<lf>you peel it off and go for a dip?
