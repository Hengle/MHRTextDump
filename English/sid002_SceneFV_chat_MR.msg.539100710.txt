<string>...Well done.
<string>...Admirable work, Hunter.
<string>...Impressive.
<string>Stay vigilant.
<string>...A time and place for<lf>everything. Including detours.
<string>...Stay focused.
<string>Hmph. I don't have the same<lf>strength as when I was younger.
<string>As have you, Fiorayne! You continue<lf>to grow by leaps and bounds!
<string>You are too, right!?<lf>C'mon, you aren't foolin' anyone.
<string>Ahhh! Reminds me of the good ol' days.<lf>Wouldn't you say, Arlow?
<string>Thank you Hunter for this<lf>time well-spent.
<string>I saw YOU watching ME the whole time!<lf>Next time focus on the hunt. Not me.
<string>You know, Jae. I wish you'd<lf>calm down a bit.
<string>And from the good Elder, as well!<lf>We owe it to the youth to lead the way.
<string>It was an honor accompanying<lf>you and our young hero today!
