<string>The Rampage is approaching!<lf>OK, get ready!
<string>We managed to fight them off!<lf>What a relief...
<string>It's no good!<lf>We have to retreat!
<string>We did it!<lf>OK, we should retreat for now!
<string>The Stronghold is in shambles,<lf>but at least we got the job done...
<string>Mission complete! Great job!
<string>You completed all of the missions!?<lf>Wow! You're amazing!
<string>A new mission is ready!<lf>Just waiting on you!
<string>Here they come! We'll fight<lf>them off...for Kamura!
<string>Another wave's on the way!<lf>Better prepare while you can!
<string>This is the last of them!<lf>Hang in there!
<string>A gate is being attacked!<lf>Go stop them!
<string>Gate destroyed! But we're not<lf>ready to throw in the towel yet!
<string>A horde made it past!<lf>Hurry, it has to be stopped!
<string>Oh, no! The last gate!<lf>We can't let them break through!
<string>The last gate won't hold much longer!<lf>Do something!
<string>Uh-oh, that monster<lf>is gonna target the gates!
<string>That monster is attacking<lf>hunters! Watch yourself!
<string>Careful—that monster has<lf>some terrifying ranged attacks!
<string>Wind Serpent Ibushi sighted<lf>overhead...and here it comes!
<string>The monsters are almost here!<lf>Please be careful!
<string>Something awfully powerful is<lf>heading this way! Watch yourself!
<string>Woohoo, I can feel the power!<lf>Chaaaaaarge!
<string>Everyone's super pumped!<lf>Now's the time we strike back!
<string>Installation down, but it'll be<lf>fixed real soon!
<string>Apex sighted! If we can take it<lf>out, we should be OK!
<string>The Apex is readying an attack!<lf>This doesn't look good...
<string>Sweet Bunny Dangos!<lf>I've never seen strength like this!
<string>Oh, no! I think that roar made<lf>the horde even stronger!
<string>The Apex is destroying the<lf>Stronghold! It's relentless!
<string>Don't overexert yourself! I'll<lf>be right here when you get back!
<string>Yeah! That installation is kickin'<lf>their monster butts!
<string>Guess that installation's wasn't<lf>the right choice... B-But I'm not judging!
<string>Everything you've done inspires<lf>us all to reach higher!
<string>Wow, you're really something!<lf>We've gotta keep up over here!
<string>Wow, <PL>! You're<lf>totally unmatched!
<string>You're our flame of hope!<lf>Burn bright, <PL>!
<string><PL>!<lf>We can do this together!
<string>I won't let them touch Kamura!<lf>I'll defend it to the end!
<string>Thoughts of Ibushi... Th-They<lf>keep welling up— Ngh...!
<string>Minoto...I-I'm OK. Please...<lf>Defend Kamura in my stead...
<string>I can feel Ibushi's rage in my<lf>chest... Burning...like fire!
<string>Wiredashing allows for speedy<lf>traversal. Very handy.
<string>Oh, <PL>?<lf>Could you come with me?
<string>Press <OPT DECIDE> while in front of<lf>the Gathering Hub to enter.
