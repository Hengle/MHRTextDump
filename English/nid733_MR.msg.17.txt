<string>Come talk to Supy!
<string>Sorry for suddenly calling you over.<lf>This is a topic close to Supy's heart—<lf>your Palicoes!
<string>Nagi at the Buddy Piazza is having<lf>a healer upgrade campaign! And Supy's<lf>helping him purr-omote it!
<string>All you need to do is complete three<lf>master rank quests with a Healer-type<lf>Palico!
<string>Once you finish, your Palicoes will have<lf>access to an exciting new type of Support<lf>Move! Supy loves Support Moves!
<string>Supy knew ya could do it!
<string>You did it! And ya made it look easy, too!<lf>A new Support Move awaits your Felyne<lf>fur-iends! Supy is so purr-oud of you!
<string>This new type of Support Move uses some<lf>kind of bat! Supy has wandered to many places,<lf>but Supy has never heard of such a thing!
<string>Either way, I hope you and your Palicoes<lf>put it to good use!
<string>Do you have a sec for Supy?
<string>Sup, Hunter! Do you know Meowster Kogarashi?<lf>He lives in Kamura Village. Supy owes him<lf>a serious debt!
<string>Supy was meow-t wandering when suddenly<lf>a meownster appeared! Supy would have been<lf>supper, but Meowster Kogarashi saved me!
<string>Supy wants to repay him by further<lf>upgrading his armor, but Supy doesn't<lf>have any materials...
<string>Do you think you can go meow-t and get<lf>the materials for me? Pleeeeease!
<string>Thanks so much!
<string>Purrfect! Meow Supy can upgrade Meowster<lf>Kogarashi's armor!
<string>You can now forge im-purr-oved Buddy<lf>armor! Make sure to keep all of your<lf>Buddies well-equipped!
<string>Thanks again for helping me, Hunter.<lf>Supy is always grateful fur all your<lf>kindness!
<string>Do you have a sec for Supy?
<string>Every meow and then, Supy encounters an<lf>antique that's truly un-fur-gettable. And the<lf>same thing can happen with meownsters!
<string>Have you ever seen a Pyre Rakna-Kadaki<lf>before? That blazing carapace, those long<lf>paws— Hmmm. Those aren't paws... *ahem*
<string>Anyway, Supy has wandered to many places,<lf>but Supy has never seen a meownster like<lf>that before!
<string>Supy wants to see one again, but the Lava<lf>Caverns and a body covered in fur don't mix!<lf>Do you think you can capture one for me?
<string>Supy knew ya could do it!
<string>You really captured one for me!? Meow!<lf>What a wonderful prize! Supy loves prizes!
<string>Fur your reward, Supy has purr-pared<lf>some special gear fur you! Go over to<lf>the Smithy to check it meow-t!
<string>Isn't she beautiful, Hunter? Supy knows<lf>it's a meownster, but meownsters can<lf>be beautiful, too!
<string>Sup, Hunter! Meow! Did you come to talk<lf>to me?
<string>Supy has wandered to many places,<lf>but Supy has never seen a hunter like<lf>you before! Pleased to meet you!
<string>Oh, by the way, I'm Supy! Wandering<lf>Felyne Supy to be more purr-ecise!
<string>Are you going to be in Elgado fur a while?<lf>Maybe we can have some dango together<lf>sometime! Supy loves dango!
<string>Sup, Hunter! Are you interested in<lf>purr-culiar things? Supy loves<lf>purr-culiar things!
<string>There are so many purr-culiar things in<lf>this world that Supy is curious about!<lf>Supy loves being curious!
<string>Right meow, Supy is curious about Elgado<lf>and all the purr-culiar people here!
<string>If you're going to Kamura Village,<lf>Purr-haps Supy could tag along, too?
<string>Kamura sounds like such an interesting<lf>place! Supy has wandered to many<lf>places and wants to visit more!
<string>Mew...<lf>It's not fair to keep it all to yourself.
<string>Sup, Hunter! Welcome back! Purr-haps<lf>you brought Supy a souvenir...?
<string>...N-Nothing?
<string>Don't sweat it! One day Supy will wander<lf>over to Kamura Village and pick up<lf>something nice for himself!
<string>Sup, Hunter! Supy was wondering if purr-<lf>haps Supy could accompany you on one<lf>of your quests?
<string>Supy is sure we'll have an exciting adventure!<lf>Supy loves adventure!
<string>...But do you think you can purr-otect<lf>Supy from the scary meownsters...?
<string>You can't just sit around on your tail,<lf>waiting for adventure to happen. You<lf>have to take that first step!
<string>Just put one paw in front of the other,<lf>and the next thing you know, you're<lf>off on a su-purr exciting adventure!
<string>Sup, Hunter! Did someone get into<lf>a cat fight?
<string>Mew...<lf>Everyone needs to get along. Fighting<lf>just makes Supy hungry...
<string>Sup, Hunter! I'm not sure about you,<lf>but Supy has been Felyne on edge lately...
<string>Purr-haps it's because everyone's been<lf>talking about those Kingdom meownsters!
<string>Stupid scary Kingdom meownsters! Wait—<lf>...What exactly are Kingdom meownsters?
<string>Oh! Sup, Hunter! Supy was wondering if<lf>you went somewhere! Did you find anything<lf>purr-culiar while you were meow-t there?
<string>Meow, meow. Don't be shy! Supy loves<lf>purr-culiar things! Oh! You found some<lf>meownster tracks? Good work, Hunter!
<string>B-But be careful... Meownster tracks lead<lf>to meownsters! And meownsters are<lf>scary!
<string>That's strange...<lf>Supy can't find Bahari anywhere...
<string>Huh!? He's meow-t there chasing after<lf>a meownster!?
<string>B-But he was just being chased by<lf>a meownster! Supy is so confused...
<string>Wait, wait...<lf>He's not meow-t playing tag with meownsters,<lf>is he!?
<string>Sup, Hunter! Have ya heard? Tails of<lf>your heroic deeds have spread beyond<lf>the borders of Elgado!
<string>Everyone is su-purr grateful that you're<lf>hunting those scary Kingdom meownsters!
<string>Keep it up, meow! If you become a really<lf>big su-purr star, Supy can say, "Hey<lf>that's my fur-iend!"
<string>Sup, Hunter! Supy was wondering about<lf>those strange glowing creatures Fiorayne<lf>saw flying in the sky...
<string>Supy loves strange glowing creatures! Did<lf>you see it glow? Was it like a Lanternbug?<lf>Oh, Supy really wants one meow!
<string>Supy heard Bahari caught some Qurio,<lf>but when Supy when to Bahari's lab,<lf>he kicked meow-t...
<string>That's OK! Supy can go get his own Qurio!<lf>Catch 'em with my own two paws—<lf>Huh? That's a bad idea? Mew...
<string>Sup, Hunter! Supy is so glad you are OK!<lf>Everyone can't stop talking about Meowzeno!
<string>Meow Supy's paws won't stop shaking!<lf>Supy just needs to take a few breaths.<lf>*inhale*... *exhale*... *inhale*... *exhale*...
<string>Mew... That's better. We need to keep<lf>our cool, especially at a time like this!<lf>Right, Hunter?
<string>A Wyverian doctor? Supy's wandered to<lf>many places and met many people, but<lf>Supy's never heard of this "Tadori" fellow.
<string>But if Supy hears of anything, you'll be<lf>the first to know! Purr-omise!
<string>Meow, Hunter! You're good at hunting down<lf>people, too, huh? Supy's sure hunting some<lf>ingredients won't be hard at all!
<string>Looks like you don't need Supy at all...<lf>Supy'll just keep hanging out here, then.<lf>Maybe the purr-incess will talk to me.
<string>Sup, Hunter! if you've got nothing to do<lf>until the medicine is ready, want to<lf>take a walk around Elgado with Supy?
<string>...Oh, you're still busy? Of course you are!<lf>You're the hardest working hunter Supy<lf>knows!
<string>Mew... It's been forever since Supy did<lf>much of anything, to be honest. Supy's<lf>paws are getting lazy...
<string>Sup, Hunter! Meow! You look so calm,<lf>even at a time like this! But you're all<lf>excited inside, right?
<string>No need to hide it. There's nothing to be<lf>ashamed of! But maybe Supy is more<lf>excited than you!
<string>Hunter, Hunter, Hunter! Supy can't believe<lf>it! You did it! Supy would be speechless,<lf>but Supy has so many things to say!
<string>Please tell Supy about your epic hunt!<lf>Supy loves stories! C'mon! Pleeeeeeease!
<string>Supy knows everyone wants to talk to<lf>you! But please make time for Supy, too!
<string>Supy sometimes hears someone singing<lf>a strange song— Meow, no! Supy's got<lf>it stuck in his head again...
<string>It's so annoying... It's not a bad song, but<lf>it's not good either. Whoever's singing it<lf>really knows how to find that sweet spot!
<string>First, Supy can't get it out of his head,<lf>then Supy starts humming it! "Yowl-<lf>ho-hooo~♪ Meow-ho-hooooooo~♪"
<string>That ship is so big and cool! I wonder if<lf>I can take a trip on it! Supy loves trips!<lf>Can you ask for Supy, Hunter? Please?
<string>Oh, you have quests to do? It's OK!<lf>Supy is patient! When you get back,<lf>then we'll go!
<string>OK, Hunter! Off you go! Supy's paws<lf>are waiting here!
<string>Sup, Hunter! Meow! You saved Elgado!<lf>Supy is su-purr purr-oud of you!
<string>Supy has really come to love this outpost.<lf>And meow Supy has so many fur-iends here!
<string>Like you, Hunter! Supy has wandered to<lf>many places, but Supy has never made<lf>a fur-iend like you before!
<string>Supy's hanging out in Elgado because<lf>maybe something exciting is gonna<lf>happen here...
<string>Don't tell me, you too? Great minds,<lf>Hunter! And you don't even have<lf>Supy's Felyne instincts!
<string>Supy has wandered to many places,<lf>but even Supy was surprised by how<lf>strange and unique Elgado is...
<string>Like, how many meowtposts have you<lf>been to that are right beside a gigantic<lf>crater!? None, right?
<string>Supy is gonna stick around for a while<lf>to see if something interesting happens!<lf>It's bound to in a place like this!
<string>Oh! Sup, Hunter! What a strange coincidence<lf>that we keep bumping into each other!<lf>You're not following Supy are you?
<string>You're not? Meow, good... You're a hunter<lf>so maybe you were wondering if Supy<lf>was a scary meownster...
<string>But Supy's not a meownster!<lf>...Or scary! You don't think Supy's<lf>scary do you!?
<string>Oh, did you come to talk to Supy? But<lf>everyone looks so busy. Are you sure<lf>you have time?
<string>Supy doesn't want to keep you fur-om<lf>doing anything su-purr important.<lf>But Supy has been pawfully lonely...
<string>Everyone's like, "What about Meowzeno!?<lf>What about Meowzeno!?" but Supy was<lf>wondering, "What about Supy!?" Mew...
<string>To be honest, Supy wasn't planning to stay<lf>in Elgado this long.
<string>Supy loves adventure! So where Supy's<lf>paws take him, Supy goes... But now<lf>Supy has many fur-iends in Elgado!
<string>So my paws are gonna stay right here<lf>for a little longer! Supy hopes your<lf>paws will stay, too!
<string>Oboro has so many purr-culiar trinkets<lf>in his shop! Supy loves trinkets!
<string>Supy has wandered to many places<lf>but has never seen such a selection<lf>of strange and mysterious goods!
<string>Seems like Supy hasn't wandered<lf>enough... Might be time for Supy<lf>to get back on the road!
<string>Purr-haps Supy can find something<lf>that could surprise Oboro? If there<lf>is, Supy's gonna find it!
