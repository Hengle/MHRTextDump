<string>These Elgado monsters.<lf>They're a little different.
<string>They're so aggressive...<lf>Not sure we can be fur-iends.
<string>I heard the Admiral shout all way over<lf>here! Made my fur stand on end!
<string>And meow I have to pick up all these letters<lf>I dropped...
<string>Kingdom meownsters in the wrong<lf>postcode, huh?
<string>Er... Maybe they got the wrong address?
<string>Well, those meownsters definitely can't<lf>become couriers! We'd never make<lf>a mistake like that... N-Never...
<string>Garangolm...<lf>Meow, that's a strong name!
<string>A strong name for a strong meownster!
<string>Don't worry, <PL>! You got<lf>this! And you have our su-purr-t!<lf>Signed, sealed, and delivered!
<string>I'm glad Bahari made it back to Elgado<lf>safely!
<string>Mew know, making sure a package arrives<lf>safe and sound is key to being a Courier.
<string>If you ever wanted a change of pace,<lf>you could switch careers!
<string>Qu-Qurio? *hiss* Those things raise my<lf>hackles!
<string>Apple colored, but scary. No thank you...
<string>It seems the air has changed in Elgado.<lf>My whiskers feel all tingly...
<string>Maybe it means I can make some new<lf>meownster fur-iends...
<string>But maybe it's difficult to make fur-iends<lf>with those Qurio.
<string>Meowllo, meowllo, <PL>.<lf>Everyone in Elgado sure looks worried...
<string>Maybe they need a nice package fur-om<lf>you.
<string>If you can deliver a smile, then maybe<lf>it'll cheer everyone up!
<string>Meowllo, meowllo, <PL>.<lf>Oh, you look like you're raring to go today!<lf>I'm glad, but...
<string>I'm still worried about Lady Fiorayne...<lf>I hope she recovers soon!
<string>They say, "An apple a day, keeps the doctor<lf>away" So maybe if I bring her my best apple,<lf>she'll get better!
<string>Meowzeno!? That sounds terrifying!
<string>No more making fur-iends with meownsters!<lf>Some need to be left well alone.
<string>I'll be here! Mew be careful out there!
<string>Meowllo, meowllo, <PL>.<lf>Welcome back!
<string>Seems you delivered some good news<lf>and meow everyone in Elgado looks<lf>happy!
<string>I hope the good doctor's medicine will<lf>help Fiorayne fully recu-purr-rate from<lf>her injuries!
<string>Elgado is still buzzing. The tingling in<lf>the air is still making the fur on the<lf>back of my neck stand up...
<string>And meow the Qurio are acting strange?<lf>Maybe they need a mew fur-iend?
<string>But the Qurio don't seem very fur-iendly...<lf>Maybe it's because they've never received<lf>a package delivered with a smile!
<string>Meowllo, meowllo, <PL>!<lf>Do you know what's going on?
<string>The sky looks pawfully sad today.
<string>Gloomy weather really gets me down,<lf>but it won't stop me fur-om delivering <lf>the mail with a smile!
<string>You've got more mail than a Felyne<lf>has lives, <PL>.
<string>I need to deliver it, but I'm not sure where<lf>to deliver it to!
<string>Make sure you check your mail often,<lf>OK!?
<string>Meowllo, meowllo, <PL>!<lf>Welcome back!
<string>Elgado is all smiles again and it's all<lf>thanks to you!
<string>It's so re-fur-eshing to see everyone<lf>in such a good mew-d! You're always<lf>delivering smiles to everyone!
<string>Are you sure you don't want to be<lf>a Courier?
<string>The Spelunker looks fun to ride!<lf>Meow, Elgado sure is a neat place!
<string>Do you think I can ride it?<lf>J-Just to carry the mail, of course....
<string>It could purr-ovide a safe and reliable<lf>service!
<string>That Bishaten meownster sure is funny!
<string>Bouncing around on its tail?<lf>I want to join in!
<string>Do you think I can be fur-iends with one?<lf>Only one way to find out!
<string>Mew... My belly is rumbling.
<string>Everyone in Elgado loves dango, but<lf>meow about apples? Do you think<lf>they could make apple dango!?
<string>I'll go and ask. Bring me apple dango!
<string>Meowllo, meowllo, Hunter! As Courier,<lf>I'm always delivering packages, letters,<lf>and all sorts of mail!
<string>And when I'm delivering them,<lf>it's like I'm delivering smiles!
<string>Mew... Sometimes, I'd like to get<lf>a letter myself... Purr-haps you can<lf>send me a smile?
<string>As a Courier, you learn a lot of things<lf>from your job. Like, "never give up,"<lf>for example.
<string>We deliver the mail in all sorts of weather<lf>conditions, rain, sleet, snow! We never<lf>give up!
<string>Maybe that's a valuable lesson for you<lf>hunters, mew— I mean, too!
<string>Meowllo, meowllo, Hunter! Did I tell<lf>you how much I love apples? ...I did?<lf>Oh! Well, guess what!
<string>The special apple dango I requested...<lf>they're finally finished! See!<lf>"Never give up!"
<string>Mew... I'm so hungry, though.<lf>I need those dango, special delivery!
<string>Special delivery!
<string>Meowllo, meowllo, <PL>!<lf>Got a special delivery fur ya! It's some<lf>new add-on content!
