<string>I gave my weapon some extra<lf>love and care just for today!
<string>What a delight this will be!<lf>It's time to have some fun!
<string>I simply cannot wait!<lf>The feeling is mutual, right?
<string>It's been a long time since<lf>I hunted with someone else!
<string>Today is sure to be a<lf>challenge, so no holding back!
<string>Let's hurry up and make<lf>our way to the monsters!
<string>I'm impressed with your poise,<lf>quite unlike the others!
<string>Much obliged for today!<lf>Let's make the most of it!
<string>Today is sure to be a challenge!<lf>The tougher, the better, I say!
<string>Just wait 'till I got the monster<lf>in my sights!
<string>What's the matter, Fiorayne?<lf>Are you all right?
<string>I'm in my element, you know?<lf>This is my happy place.
<string>You may all relax, I'll have this<lf>wrapped up in time for tea!
<string>Pfft! There's no shame in enjoying your<lf>craft! OK, monsters! Who's first!?
<string>Tone WHAT down? Can't we hunt<lf>without all your "protocol"!?
<string>Don't think about it too much,<lf>Fiorayne. Just enjoy yourself!
<string>Let us hurry! I wish to<lf>try out my new weapon!
<string>Fiorayne, the monsters have<lf>all run away...
<string>Oh, I'm focused alright! Focused on<lf>getting a monster in my sights!
<string>That's the spirit, Master Arlow!
<string>Let's get moving! There're beasts<lf>out there ready to be hunted!
<string>You always say these things with<lf>such passion, Master Arlow.
<string>I knew it!<lf>I knew we were the same!
<string>You're not getting cold feet on<lf>me now? Pull yourself together!
<string>Put a little more heart into it, Jae!<lf>This hunt could be our last!
<string>Jae!
<string>Watch your tongue, JAE!
<string>We are knights of the Royal Order!<lf>That's all that matters! GOT IT!?
<string>Shut up and concentrate before<lf>I use your muscles as bait!
