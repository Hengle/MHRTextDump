<string>Dear! Looks like we've been<lf>caught in the act, Minoto.
<string>Quite disappointing, Hinoa.
<string>I really don't see how anyone could've<lf>noticed us...
<string>It was a perfect display of stealth...
<string>That's why we expect great things of you,<lf>you're always razor-sharp!
<string>Well then, I guess we still have a lot of<lf>training left to do.
<string>What, you don't want us sneaking in!?
<string>Oh, come on! This is Kamura,<lf>we're all practically family here!
<string>Besides, Elder Fugen is looking for you.
<string>So go get ready! Can't keep him waiting!
<string>Shall we go?
<string>Elder Fugen, we did like you asked!
<string>Oh! Hinoa, Minoto, thank you!
<string>I just got an important letter.
<string>It looks like...
<string>We've got a Rampage on our hands.
<string>So it's finally beginning...
<string>Hm.
<string>It's been fifty years since the last<lf>calamity...
<string>But I remember...like it was yesterday.
<string>
<string>A horde of monsters
<string>The Rampage
<string>
<string>A huge pack of monsters<lf>in a giant stampede...
<string>
<string>They attack the village<lf>in a frenzied rage...
<string>
<string>Nobody knows why this happens...
<string>
<string>But it came close to<lf>wiping out our village last time.
<string>I think it's time...we paid a visit<lf>to the Stronghold.
<string>We have to protect the village!
<string>There's nothing to worry about,<lf>Elder Fugen!
<string>All of us, everyone in Kamura... We've all been<lf>training for this moment for our ENTIRE lives!
<string>Hinoa, we should start preparations<lf>right away.
<string>Hmhm!
<string>Now that's what I like to hear!
