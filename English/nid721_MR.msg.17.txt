<string>I need to talk to you!
<string>Are your Palicoes pulling their weight?<lf>I've got some info to help your furry<lf>pals pull out all the stops!
<string>Nagi at the Buddy Piazza told me there's<lf>a special Fighter upgrade campaign going<lf>on right now!
<string>It's super easy! Just complete three master<lf>rank quests with a Fight-type Palico!
<string>Once you're done, your Palicoes will<lf>have access to a new type of Support<lf>Move! Nothing to lose!
<string>You did it!
<string>Now your Palicoes can use a new type<lf>of Support Move! You can't go wrong with<lf>more ways to hunt!
<string>The move itself seems to involve a<lf>musical instrument. An alluring melody<lf>that rouses courage among allies!
<string>Music is culture! This kind of cultural<lf>exchange just another form of trade;<lf>so very important!

<string>A hunter from Kamura Village!?<lf>I can't believe it! It's a purrrleasure to meet you!
<string>Trading with Kamura has allowed us to<lf>experience all kinds of tasty treats!
<string>I hope we can continue trading with Kamura!<lf>Certainly it will be most bene-fish-cial! See<lf>you around, Hunter!
<string>Not only is the outpost used to observe<lf>that massive crater, it's also used<lf>as a way station for trade.
<string>That's why rare fish that can't be<lf>easily caught in this area are<lf>available in the stores.
<string>I'm not sure if I've ever seen a more<lf>attractive product line, I can't help<lf>but admire it.
<string>Hey, Hunter!<lf>Could you say hi to Rondine for me?
<string>And while you're at it, give my regards<lf>to Kotori and Chino too!
<string>Welcome back.<lf>Meow was everyone?
<string>Actually, don't answer that.<lf>I'll ask them myself!
<string>It's easy to see from the trade goods<lf>that arrived from the village.<lf>It looks like everyone is doing well!
<string>The long awaited investigation is finally<lf>about to begin. Now it's time to show off<lf>my skills!
<string>Leave the supplies to us.<lf>We'll never let the research team or you<lf>hunters run out of tools!
<string>If the Jungle was a safer place,<lf>it would be easier to trade by land<lf>than it is right meow.
<string>Then we wouldn't have to worry about<lf>sea voyagers during rough weather.<lf>I'm counting on you, Hunter!
<string>If you're going out somewhere, Hunter,<lf>maybe some shopping befur you leave?
<string>What's that? An urgent quest?<lf>Furgive me, this store doesn't stock<lf>anything useful for hunting...
<string>The ship we returned from Kamura on<lf>was unusually light on cargo...
<string>I'm sure it was difficult for them, too.<lf>You have my thanks, Hunter.
<string>It's hard to make customers happy when<lf>the only things you can offer them<lf>are daily necessities.
<string>That's why I'd like to sell things that will<lf>make everyday life in Elgado<lf>a little more enjoyable.
<string>Hey, Hunter, any idea what's going<lf>on in Kamura Village?
<string>I've been Felyne like Flur has been<lf>keeping an eye on me lately.
<string>Is there something I can help you with?<lf>Purrrhaps you are looking for<lf>something else?
<string>I haven't heard from anyone in Kamura<lf>Village lately. No news is good news,<lf>I guess...
<string>Is it possible they're having so much<lf>fun over there that they've forgotten<lf>all about me...?
<string>I have to know! If Kamura Village is really<lf>that fun then I have to go there too!
<string>Treats that fill the belly and give you<lf>strength are popular among the knights<lf>and other hunters.
<string>Besides, snacks that fill the belly<lf>are a hit with the researchers.
<string>Us sailors love them too, of course!
<string>You know I was thinking, what would<lf>Qurio taste like if we tried cooking it?
<string>Meow...! Pretend I didn't say that!<lf>Please furrget I said anything...
<string>I'm always busy coming up with ideas<lf>for new products that my imagination<lf>sometimes runs away with me!
<string>I'm also in charge of trade here,<lf>so I get a lot of requests from the local<lf>research team.
<string>The most popular items are those from<lf>the Kingdom! I guess it gives them<lf>that furmiliar feeling of home.
<string>I understand. It reminds me of home, too.
<string><VO:SER>I heard from a knight who came to the<lf>store. I want to believe that everything<lf>will be OK, but I'm still worried...
<string>Master Arlow has a stern look on his face.<lf>It's not like him...
<string>Sorry, Hunter, but unfurtunately Espinas<lf>poison is not something I see pass<lf>through my trade routes.
<string>I don't have it in the store either, so it<lf>looks like hunting is the only way<lf>to obtain it.
<string>Beware, Hunter.<lf>Espinas is one scary-looking meownster!
<string>So? Espinas are scary right?<lf>I told you so, Hunter!
<string>I knew it! The part that scares me the<lf>meowst are those spiky things!
<string>I have a phobia of spiky things, you see.<lf>They give me the heebie-jeebies!
<string>I want all the knights and hunters<lf>to be full of energy when they<lf>take on the big game.
<string>That's why we're offering a big discount<lf>today! I don't care if we lose a little<lf>money. Give it your all out there!
<string>Thank you so much for hunting<lf>Meowzeno, Hunter! Purrhaps meow<lf>trading will be a little safer.
<string>What's a little concerning is that some<lf>of the research team members<lf>still look troubled.
<string>They've already defeated the Three<lf>Lords. Whatever could it be that's<lf>worrying them?
<string>You see these Spelunker rails, Hunter?
<string>We use them to transport super heavy cargo.<lf>Boy, do they make a racket!
<string>The Spelunker is so much fun.<lf>I feel a little sorry for everyone<lf>who doesn't get to ride it...
<string>What's up with the sky? Do you think<lf>the Qurio could come here? I hope they <lf>don't come and take a bite outta me!
<string>This might not be a good time<lf>to be selling fish...
<string>Or would it be better for everyone<lf>if business went on as usual in times<lf>like these...?
<string>Thanks to you, both land and sea<lf>routes have become much safer<lf>than befur.
<string>Now the use of ships for research and<lf>trade has been booming, I've got a lot<lf>in my bowl!
<string>So, Hunter, when you're not busy, why not<lf>lend me a paw here at the store? In return,<lf>I'll let you choose any fish you want.
<string>When I'm not in the store, my job is to take<lf>care of the ship's cargo and trade goods.
<string>As long as I'm keeping an eye on<lf>things around here, everything runs smoothly.
<string>I've always been in charge of trading<lf>goods for the guild, so I'm confident<lf>that I have a good selection.
<string>These things come in through special trade<lf>routes, and are very popular with customers<lf>who can tell how different they are!
<string>I had a great idea the other day while<lf>eating my customary Bunny Dango<lf>on the way home from work.
<string>Why don't we make something special<lf>that could be popular abroad? We<lf>could call it the "Elgado specialty"!
<string>But what could this Elgado specialty<lf>be exactly? Hmm...yes, this is<lf>quite the pickle I find myself in.
<string>Hunter, Hunter! I've done it! I've finally<lf>come up with an idea for the Elgado<lf>specialty I was talking about!
<string>It's a wood carving I carefully painted<lf>to look just like the Qurio, I call it<lf>the Qurio doll! What do you think?
<string>Something tells me you aren't too<lf>keen on this idea, Hunter...well,<lf>it's true it hasn't been selling well...
<string>I've finally created my Elgado specialty,<lf>to compete with Bunny Dango. It's made<lf>using bread from the Kingdom.
<string>I call it "Crater Stew Bread"! A big ol'<lf>round loaf of bread hollowed out in the<lf>middle, and hot stew poured inside!
<string>But in the first batch, the stew kept<lf>leaking out the bottom. It might take<lf>a while before it's complete...
<string>You know Hayate and Raiden from<lf>the Buddy Piazza? They're always<lf>looking over here at lunchtime.
<string>I can't take it when they look at me<lf>like that. It really makes me want to<lf>give them some of this fish...
