<string>Take your time to explore!<lf>It won't hinder the quest!
<string>A new adventure beings!<lf>What new discoveries await!?
<string>I will do my best to exceed<lf>your expectations!
<string>It's been ages since I've been<lf>to these grounds. How fun!
<string>Today I shall put my hunting<lf>acumen on full display!
<string>To be honest, Chino and Kotori<lf>wanted to come along too!
<string>Business is closed, but they<lf>are looking after the place.
<string>Maybe next time you can<lf>take them out on a hunt!
<string>Really appreciate the help.<lf>We'll make short work of this.
<string>Many people have helped me out<lf>since I came to the village.
<string>I'd like to return the favor,<lf>especially to you!
<string>My performance was impeccable,<lf>I'm sure our Hunter here will agree.
<string>Hm? What's with that smirk<lf>on your face?
<string>Dearest Sister... I hope that you may<lf>be able to relax more than "a bit."
<string>Yes, of course. However they've<lf>been asking me about you.
<string>Do please stop by and see them<lf>the next time you are in Kamura.
<string>I'd love for you to see all of the lovely<lf>items we have in our collection, as well.
<string>Never thought I'd have the chance<lf>to enjoy hunting with my sister...
<string>It's all thanks to you,<lf><PL>. Thank you, truly...
<string>Hero of Kamura! Bear witness<lf>to the strength of sisterhood!
<string>Yes, they are rather popular.<lf>Even my dear sister adores them.
<string>Do they taste any different from the ones<lf>you are accustomed to back home?
<string>Ha! But that's what everyone<lf>loves about you, dear Hinoa!
<string>But I'll be sure to pass along<lf>the compliment to my sister!
<string>I wonder if we'll find anything<lf>useful for trading out here...
<string>You could say that...<lf>It's almost habit now.
<string>I thought perhaps they'd never<lf>get you out of that Hub!
<string>Your will to protect your sister<lf>is strong indeed!
<string>Ha! I only jest. I, too, understand<lf>the power of sisterly love!
<string>Yes, I do apologize. I tried to avoid<lf>talking about myself, because, well...
<string>But now there is no need for secrecy,<lf>we can talk about anything you want!
<string>I've left Chino and Kotori to<lf>watch over it. You needn't worry!
<string>How about the Hub's<lf>quest counter?
<string>Haha. Yes, yes.<lf>I believe so.
