<string>In order to protect Hinoa<lf>and the village...
<string>I vow to give it my all<lf>during this quest!
<string>I'll cherish my time together<lf>with you, Hero of Kamura.
<string>I'll burn all of the details<lf>into my memory.
<string>Let's hurry up and finish this<lf>quest so we can head home.
<string>Which is another way of saying<lf>I'd rather not be outside.
<string>This daytime jungle weather<lf>is worse than I imagined...
<string>But I won't wilt under<lf>the sun, I will flourish!
<string>Who knew nature would pack<lf>a bigger punch than monsters!?
<string>But I won't give up! For Hinoa,<lf>I'd fight on the sun's surface!
<string>No matter where, no matter<lf>what, I'll do my best!
<string>I'm nervous I'm just going to<lf>get in the way of you two...
<string>Really? Thank you! You've<lf>restored my confidence!
<string>Ugh. I hate going outside, but<lf>I'll do anything to protect Hinoa!
<string>Heh. Not as much as you have...
<string>I'll do everything in my power<lf>to protect my—
<string>Well, OK! But I don't want to hear<lf>anything about being hungry!
<string>Just you wait!<lf>I've got some new tricks...!
<string>Even if a horde of elder dragons show<lf>up, I'll take on every single one of them!
<string>Uh... No, that's OK. Really.<lf>This is more than enough!
<string>R-Really? I think I'm better suited<lf>for quest reception work...
<string>Uh, <PL>... I think<lf>it's time we headed home.
<string>I'm just a humble receptionist, and I'll<lf>do my job to the best of my ability.
<string>Doing this for Hinoa...<lf>Doing this for Hinoa...
<string>Trust me, as soon as this quest<lf>is over, I'm running back inside...
<string>I didn't know you had<lf>an older sister, Rondine...
<string>Can we talk about something<lf>other than Bunny Dango?
<string>Is the trading counter OK<lf>without you there, Rondine?
<string>Well, my best customer is here, so...<lf>Maybe it's OK?
