<string><CAM:2>Now, <PL>!<lf>Rampage and all aside,<lf>I've got news for you.
<string><VO:SP1>Got a message from the Guild<lf>this morning, says that YOU...<lf>are now a certified hunter!
<string><VO:NOR>You're really livin' now, Squirt—Well, I guess,<lf>I shouldn't call you that now you're certified,<lf>but don't think it'll stop me! Bwahaha!
<string><NPC:35><VO:SP1>...Sorry to interrupt, Elder Fugen.
<string><CAM:3><VO:NOR>I've informed the village of<lf>the coming Rampage, like<lf>you asked.
<string><NPC:1>Ah, yes! Thank you.
<string><NPC:35><VO:SP1>By the way, <PL>,<lf>I overheard the good news. You're finally<lf>an official hunter? Wow, congratulations!
<string><VO:NOR>All you need to do now is register<lf>with the Guild so you can start<lf>accepting all those quests.
<string>To do that, you need to<lf>speak with <COLS RED>Master Hojo</COL><lf>in the Gathering Hub.
<string><VO:SP1>But that can wait!<lf>First, we go shopping!
<string><VO:NOR>You'll be needing the help of<lf>other villagers if you want to<lf>succeed out in the field. So...
<string>Follow me!
<string><CAM:4><VO:SP1>Now, where should we start?
<string><VO:NOR>Aha, of course.<lf>The "Marketeer of Mystery,"<lf><COLS RED>Kagero the Merchant</COL>!
<string><CAM:2>Well, <PL>.<lf>I see Utsushi's little quest was no match<lf>for ya! Ha! I expect nothin' less!
<string>What you learned today is the very essence<lf>of huntin'. Wherever the hunt takes you,<lf>those lessons'll always hold true.
<string>Now, Hinoa should have some<lf><COLS RED>1★</COL> quests ready for ya! Well,<lf>get to it and happy huntin'!
<string><CAM:2>Ah, <PL>!<lf>Yomogi, over in the Tea Shop,<lf>has been lookin' for ya!
<string>She seemed upset over somethin'.<lf>Go and check on her, would ya?
<string><CAM:2>Can't say I've seen anyone<lf>put more enthusiasm into<lf>huntin' a Great Izuchi! Heh!
<string>I knew ya had real talent,<lf>but you're puttin' all those<lf>other hunters to shame!
<string><VO:SER>You could even be—hmmmm...
<string><VO:NOR>Hah! Look at me here, rambling on<lf>like the old fool I am! Pretend ya<lf>heard nothing, OK? Bwahahaha!
<string>Anyhoo, now that ya handled that<lf>urgent quest, Hinoa has <COLS RED>2★</COL> quests ready<lf>to roll. Why don't you go check 'em out?
<string><CAM:2>Well, well, <PL>!<lf>Looks like you're rackin' up those notches<lf>on your huntin' belt. Speakin' of which...
<string>Iori said he needs your help with somethin'.<lf>That kid's normally the DIY-type, so I guess<lf>he sees something in ya!
<string>Him and everyone else in Kamura, I'm sure.<lf>You've got somethin' good goin' on, Squirt.<lf>Don't go and disappoint 'em now! Bwahaha!
<string>Well then, don't keep our boy waitin'!
<string><CAM:2>Ah, <PL>, back already?<lf>Good goin' huntin' that Aknosom!
<string>That's one problem down, but we got another<lf>over at the Shrine Ruins. The villagers are<lf>all spooked sayin' there's ghosts there.
<string>I'll be keepin' an eye on things,<lf>for now. But I may call for ya<lf>later if somethin' comes up.
<string>For the time bein', go see Hinoa.<lf>Takin' down that Aknosom has<lf>opened up <COLS RED>3★</COL> quests for ya!
<string>You're becomin' a fine Kamura hunter,<lf>Squirt! Keep up the good work!
<string><CAM:2><PL>! An urgent<lf>report just came in. Looks like the Rampage<lf>is gettin' close to the Shrine Ruins.
<string>Anyone halfway decent with a weapon<lf>will help me guard the area surroundin'<lf>the Stronghold.
<string>But we can't hold 'em all off.<lf>I'm gonna need you to hunt down<lf>anythin' that breaks through.
<string>We don't just do this to save<lf>our butts, but for the future<lf>of Kamura! You got that!?
<string>Take on urgent quests from<lf>Hinoa, drive back the calamity,<lf>and protect that future!
<string>Alright, <PL>!<lf>Let's show that pack of fiends what<lf>Kamura's really made of! Bwahaha!
<string><CAM:2><PL>! Good work in there!<lf>Thanks to your efforts, Kamura has<lf>emerged from this relatively unscathed.
<string><VO:SER>But things are gonna get real hairy<lf>now that we got Magnamalo on<lf>our hands.
<string>Like I was tellin' you back at the Strong-<lf>hold, that fiend showed its ugly face<lf>during the Rampage fifty years back.
<string>Ol' Ham just about lost his neck tryin'<lf>to stop it from takin' out the village.<lf>And now it's reared its ugly head again!
<string><VO:NOR><PL>! The safety of Kamura is<lf>in your hands. Hunt down that fiend<lf>and finish it for good!
<string>We're still not sure what's behind this<lf>dang Rampage, but if we find somethin'<lf>out you'll be the first to know.
<string><CAM:2><PL>!<lf>I need ya to go see Hamon. He says<lf>he wants to have a word with ya.
<string>"Kamura is more than just steel<lf>and monster hunters."
<string>Iori's been strugglin' to get what that<lf>means, but I think ol' Ham is tryin' to<lf>clue him in. In his own way, of course.
<string>Ol' Ham used to be cold as Tatara<lf>Steel, but I guess he's gettin' soft<lf>in his old age. Heh!
<string>Anyway, don't keep our man waitin'!
<string><CAM:2><PL>!<lf>Great work handlin' that urgent quest!
<string>Takin' care of that monster allowed<lf>ol' Ham to finish his thingamabob.<lf>Go check it out when you can.
<string>Don't run off just yet, there's more good<lf>news! You can now take on <COLS RED>4★</COL> quests!<lf>Get 'em from Hinoa when you're ready.
<string>And just one more thing. Magnamalo and<lf>the Rampage are almost upon us. You're<lf>doin' real good out there, don't lose focus!
<string><CAM:2><PL>!<lf>The Rampage has returned!
<string>And just as expected, Magnamalo's<lf>ugly face is among the horde!
<string>Luckily, Hamon's device was able to draw<lf>it away from the Rampage and into a secret<lf>passage that leads to the Shrine Ruins.
<string><PL>! This is it! This is our<lf>chance! Accept the urgent quest from Hinoa,<lf>and take down that fiend once and for all!
<string>For the villagers and for Kamura!<lf>Bwahaha!
<string><CAM:2>You may have defeated Magnamalo,<lf>but make no mistake, far harder<lf>hunts are ahead...
<string>Speaking of which, Hinoa has<lf><COLS RED>5★</COL> quests ready for you now.<lf>Check 'em out soon as you can!
<string>Listen here, <PL>! Because<lf>of you, the fire of hope burns bright all<lf>throughout Kamura. Don't stop now!
<string><CAM:2>Hey, <PL>!<lf>Got some big news for ya!
<string>An <COLS RED>Almudron</COL> was spotted in the Shrine Ruins!<lf>It's rarely seen outside the mountains. This<lf>must have somethin' to do with the Rampage.
<string>At any rate, we can't have this thing<lf>near Kamura. We have to stop it<lf>before it gets any closer.
<string>And as a proud hunter of Kamura,<lf>you're tasked with takin' it down.
<string>The urgent quest has been registered<lf>with Hinoa. We're countin' on you now,<lf>so get to it!
<string><CAM:2>Well, well, <PL>! Nicely done!<lf>I shoulda guessed an Almudron<lf>was no match for ya!
<string>Hinoa has <COLS RED>6★</COL> quests<lf>ready for you now!<lf>Go check 'em out!
<string>Before you run off, have ya tried out<lf>any of the quests that ol' Hoj and Minoto<lf>have for you in the Gatherin' Hub yet?
<string>Quests there are a bit tougher, but<lf>you're not afraid of a little challenge,<lf>are ya? Didn't think so! Bwahaha!
<string>With skills like yours, you need to be<lf>aimin' higher! Now get to it and may<lf>the fires of success burn bright for you!
<string>As a hunter, the goods you can<lf>purchase will be a little different.<lf>Heh!
<string>Armor, items, and, of course, a hearty<lf>pre-hunt meal! Anyway, ask Hinoa to<lf>tell you all about it!
<string>Finished shoppin' already!?<lf>Itchin' for some action, are ya?
<string>Then, head over to Master Hojo<lf>at the Gathering Hub.<lf>He's already waiting for you!
<string>Seems ol' Hoj wasted no time<lf>finalizin' your registration. Heh!
<string>Well, now that you're officially a hunter of<lf>Kamura Village, it's time for you to get out<lf>there and show us what you're made of!
<string>Ah, <PL>!<lf>Looks like Utsushi's got some basic<lf>training for ya.
<string>We all know you've got the talent,<lf>but just think of it as a warm-up<lf>exercise!
<string>Every journey begins with the first step.<lf>And yours with these 1★ quests. Take<lf>care of 'em and we'll go from there.
<string>We're all lookin' forward to seeing what<lf>you can do, Hunter of Kamura Village!
<string>Yomogi's lookin' for ya, <PL>!
<string>She looked pretty upset. Go see<lf>if you can give her a hand!
<string>A Great Izuchi is hangin' around the Shrine<lf>Ruins, huh? Lots goin' around that way as<lf>of late. Could be 'cause of the Rampage...
<string>Well, anyway. Yomogi's supplier can't make<lf>it here with that thing roamin' around. Time<lf>for another hunt, wouldn't you say?
<string>What can I do for ya, <PL>?<lf>You best get to huntin' that Great Izuchi<lf>as quick as you can!
<string>Hinoa's not herself lately...<lf>Must be the lack of Bunny Dango.<lf>Poor girl's not right without 'em!
<string>Those dango Yomogi makes really<lf>are somethin'. It's not just Hinoa<lf>that loves them, but the whole village!
<string>I mean, they fill you up AND boost<lf>morale! Make sure you eat some<lf>before you head out on a hunt.
<string>Hey, <PL>!<lf>Iori had a favor to ask of you.<lf>He should be at the Buddy Plaza.
<string>You go out and take care of that<lf>Aknosom so Iori can go fetch his<lf>little friends.
<string>What? Iori'll be fine! He's no hunter<lf>but his skill with the Charge Blade<lf>is second to none.
<string>The ruckus goin' on at the Shrine Ruins<lf>just won't let up. It must have some<lf>connection with the Rampage.
<string>I'll keep lookin' into it.<lf>You keep securin' quests<lf>and honin' your skills.
<string>The Rampage is here! We'll engage<lf>'em at the Stronghold, just ahead<lf>of the Shrine Ruins.
<string>We'll defend the perimeter while<lf>you hunt anything that makes<lf>it through our defenses!
<string>I absolutely will not let what happened<lf>fifty years ago ever happen again!<lf>We WILL protect Kamura!
<string>What I said about Kamura bein' "more<lf>than steel and hunters" seems to have<lf>stumped Iori and Yomogi.
<string>They're still young. Still naive. It<lf>hasn't clicked with them that I'm not<lf>talkin' about huntin' monsters...
<string>Can't solve all the village's problems<lf>with just physical strength. We'd be<lf>in a sorry state if that's all we tried.
<string>But they're smart kids. Sooner or<lf>later it'll come to 'em. I'm sure of it.
<string>Ah, <PL>!<lf>Been to see ol' Ham yet?
<string>I think he could shine a light on the answer<lf>Yomogi and Iori are lookin' for.
<string>If anyone gets it, it's him. A once-famous<lf>hunter turned master craftsman is the very<lf>core of what I'm talkin' about.
<string>I was wondering what ol' Ham was up<lf>to, but now we see that it's a device to<lf>separate Magnamalo from the Rampage.
<string>Just the sort of genius I'd expect from<lf>him! Well then, go hunt that Bishaten<lf>so Hamon can finish his work!
<string>Excellent work, <PL>!<lf>That Bishaten is down and Hamon<lf>finished that device of his.
<string>All we can do now is wait for<lf>Magnamalo to rear its ugly<lf>head and prepare for the fight.
<string>It won't be long, I can feel it.<lf>You keep chippin' away at those<lf>quests while we wait, OK?
<string>Hamon's device worked!<lf>We separated Magnamalo<lf>from the Rampage!
<string>It's time, <PL>. Magnamalo's<lf>in the Shrine Ruins. Hunt it down!<lf>You're the only one who can do it!
<string>We'll be here rootin' for ya! And when<lf>ya come back, you'll see a whole village<lf>of smilin' faces celebratin' your return!
<string>Not bad, <PL>. Not bad...<lf>Bwahahaha! Just kiddin' ya!<lf>That was one for the ages!
<string>You know the ol' sayin', "Strike while the<lf>iron is hot," right? Well, you better get to<lf>strikin' them quests 'cause you're on fire!
<string>An Almudron, one of those old sludge<lf>hermits, is nearin' the village.
<string>If we don't stop it at the Shrine Ruins,<lf>there's no tellin' what it'll do to Kamura!<lf>You know what to do, <PL>!
<string>Oh, hey there, <PL>! What's<lf>on the ol' huntin' agenda today? Hope you<lf>got your sights set on somethin' big!
<string>Well, if you do, there's plenty of<lf>quests waitin' for you at the Gatherin'<lf>Hub. Get to it, Hunter of Kamura!
<string>Ah, <PL>!<lf>Started Hub questin', have ya?
<string>Huntin' with friends is always a treat.<lf>So is huntin' alone. All that really<lf>matters is that you're huntin'!
<string>You got an urgent quest waitin' for ya<lf>over in the Gatherin' Hub. Complete<lf>it and your hunter rank will increase.
<string>Simple, right? Takin' the first step is<lf>simple. But the key is to keep goin'!<lf>Good luck out there!
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> nid001_h2_000
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> nid001_h2_001
<string><PL>!<lf>As I said, there's a Rampage quest<lf>waitin' for ya over in the Hub.
<string>Ol' Hoj was right about ya! You really<lf>are a gifted hunter. I know I'm leavin'<lf>the Stronghold in capable hands.
<string>Don't know how ya did it,<lf>but ya drove the whole dang<lf>horde back! Bwahaha!
<string>But don't let this little victory go<lf>to your head. This is just beginnin'<lf>and who knows when it'll end...
<string>Why do monsters band together to<lf>attack the village? If we know that,<lf>maybe we can stop it for good.
<string>Anyway, ol' Hoj and I will keep lookin'<lf>into it. As for you, there's quests to<lf>take care of, so get to it! Bwahaha!
<string>Ol' Hoj's quests are almost always<lf>difficult. Even I wonder if he's<lf>pushin' ya too hard sometimes.
<string>But I'm sure ya heard the expression,<lf>"calm seas never made a good sailor."<lf>Well, the same goes for huntin'!
<string>Ya gotta put your skills to test and push<lf>yourself if you wanna improve. You put<lf>your trust in ol' Hoj and work hard!
<string>There's an urgent Rampage quest for<lf>you over in the Gatherin' Hub. Your target<lf>is an Apex Arzuros. Now, go get to it!
<string>Ol' Hoj and Hinoa said there's somethin'<lf>fishy goin' on. And when they speak,<lf>I listen. That goes double for you!
<string><PL>...<lf>You watch your back out there now,<lf>and DON'T let your guard down!
<string><VO:SER>Can Hinoa really communicate<lf>with a monster...?
<string>I mean, her and Minoto, that's one thing.<lf>But resonatin'—or whatever ya call it—with<lf>a monster? That's a whole other story...
<string>The Guild and I will keep investigatin'.<lf>We need answers. There's no tellin'<lf>what we're really dealin' with here...
<string><VO:SER>The Guild's still investigatin' this<lf>azure beast. Utsushi and I are<lf>gonna keep diggin' too.
<string>While it's a big relief that Hinoa<lf>is OK, we can't rest until we find<lf>out what's really goin' on.
<string>As for you, <PL>...<lf>I know you're doin' a lot of heavy liftin'<lf>around here, but I'm counting on you!
<string>Hub quests goin' well? Ol' Hoj says<lf>whenever a new quest comes in, you<lf>leap to sign up and then dart off.
<string>Heh! I was just like you back in my<lf>day. Eager to take on any challenge!<lf>It's OK to be enthusiastic.
<string>Just don't do anything hasty. We can't<lf>lose you to a monster's belly before we<lf>solve the mystery of the Rampage! Heh!
<string><VO:SER>We've always thought the Rampage<lf>was simply an act of nature, somethin'<lf>built into monster behavior.
<string>To find out that the whole thing is just<lf>because of one monster... Makes my<lf>head hurt just tryin' to comprehend it.
<string>The monsters of the Rampage didn't<lf>attack us because they wanted to...
<string>In that sense, they've been wronged<lf>by the Wind Serpent just as much<lf>as we have.
<string>Listen up, <PL>!<lf>Ibushi has shown itself!
<string>It'll be the toughest challenge yet! But<lf>I believe in you! We all believe in you!<lf>Please! Our lives are in your hands!
<string><VO:SER>You may not have slain Ibushi, but<lf>I think it's safe to assume it'll keep<lf>its distance for the time bein'.
<string>However, the Rampage still looms...<lf>Sorry, <PL>. We can't<lf>let our guard down just yet.
<string><VO:SER>Minoto's been acting strange lately.<lf>Hinoa tried resonatin' with her, but,<lf>nothin'...
<string>Maybe it's because Hinoa hasn't<lf>fully recovered yet. Let's hope<lf>that's the reason...
<string><VO:SER>Could it be that Minoto and the Thunder<lf>Serpent Narwa have— No, it doesn't matter<lf>now she's OK.
<string>We should focus on takin'<lf>Narwa down. We can't let it<lf>destroy Kamura Village!
<string>If you can slay the Thunder Serpent,<lf>Kamura is as good as saved...
<string><PL>!<lf>For Kamura Village... For the villagers!<lf>Let your hunger for the hunt burn bright!
<string>Wind Serpent Ibushi and Thunder<lf>Serpent Narwa both still live!<lf>Stubborn beasts...
<string>Listen well, <PL>! Not only<lf>for Kamura, but for the sake of the<lf>world, I ask you lend us your strength!
<string>We... We're outta time. The beasts<lf>have already caught up with each<lf>other. They're at the Coral Palace.
<string>Listen to me: this battle isn't just a<lf>fight for Kamura Village—it's for all<lf>who suffer under the Rampage.
<string>But there's no-one who can bring the heat to<lf>Narwa and Ibushi besides you. So, in all our<lf>steads, go burn those two down to the ground!
<string>I can barely believe it. After so many years,<lf>the calamity that tormented us all—the<lf>Rampage—it's... I-It's finally over...
<string><PL>, Savior of Kamura! As<lf>elder of this village, I confer to you<lf>my greatest declaration of thanks!
<string>...And that's it! What? You thought I'd<lf>have some kind of "End of the Rampage"<lf>speech prepared? Bwahahaha!
<string>How ya doin', Squirt? Or, should I say,<lf>"Savior of Kamura"? Bwahahaha!
<string>Heh, lemme take a good look at ya... Yeah,<lf>it's not a bad fit as titles go. You more than<lf>earned it, <PL>... You really did.
<string>You're burning brighter than ever, Squirt,<lf>so don't stop now. And remember that ol'<lf>Fugen will be here cheerin' you on!
<string>Imagine becomin' a hunter on the same<lf>day the Rampage starts! Looks like your<lf>work's cut out for ya! Bwahahaha!
<string>But, with your talent, I know you'll<lf>be fine. Besides, you have the whole<lf>village behind you for support!
<string>Don't forget to eat at the Tea Shop before<lf>huntin'. Yomogi's Bunny Dango get you<lf>ready to hunt like nothin' else!
<string>Pay close attention to each one's effect<lf>and order according to the quest you've<lf>chosen. Remember: Eat well, hunt well!
<string>Ol' Ham and I go way back. Way back when<lf>we used to be hunters. Ol' Ham used to put<lf>the fear into monsters in those days! Heh!
<string>But Hamon's grandson, Iori, is the<lf>complete opposite of his grandfather.<lf>He's all about his furry little friends.
<string>But Ol' Ham's none too pleased with<lf>Iori's chosen profession. He thinks it<lf>makes him weak...
<string>We won't be taken by surprise like we<lf>were fifty years ago. The Stronghold is<lf>built and the villagers have been trained.
<string>Normally, non-hunters are forbidden<lf>to engage with monsters, but the<lf>Rampage ain't exactly normal, is it?
<string>You may know this already, but Hinoa<lf>is talented with a bow, and Minoto with<lf>a lance. They can put up a mean fight!
<string>Kagero came to this village from<lf>a faraway land many decades ago.<lf>He's led a rather interesting life...
<string>After he arrived, ol' Hoj took him<lf>under his wing and showed him<lf>the ways of merchantin'.
<string>Now he roams the land as a travelin'<lf>merchant. And he's built up quite<lf>the reputation as well! Heh!
<string>The sword I've entrusted to you<lf>is more of a symbolic item for<lf>ceremonies than a weapon.
<string>It doesn't do much damage, which<lf>is why I never unsheathe it even<lf>when I'm commandin'.
<string>Now it's yours to use as ya will.<lf>And who knows? Perhaps its steel<lf>holds tremendous hidden power.
<string><PL>! Good to see ya!<lf>I can see from your face that today's<lf>hunt has been a good one.
<string>How are the quests over at the Hub?<lf>Keep increasin' your rank and you'll<lf>keep gettin' bigger and badder quests!
<string>Heh, about time!
<string>Ah, Squirt! Don'tcha think you've worn<lf>out that Petalace of yours by now?
<string>If ya didn't know, the effect you receive<lf>on contact with a Spiribird changes with<lf>the type of Petalace you're wearing.
<string><NOTE:084>Tell you what—you've always been the<lf>hands-on type, so I'll give you a new<lf>one to try out for yourself. Sound good?
<string>A true Kamura Hunter knows their Petalaces.<lf>Finding which types work best for you is key<lf>to bein' a master hunter!
<string>Heh, about time!
<string>Well, if you ain't lookin' sharp with<lf>that there Petalace, heh!
<string>But now you're a high rank hunter,<lf>it's time you stepped up your<lf>supporting gear too.
<string>You gotta be prepared to take on harder<lf>quests. So how 'bout we upgrade your<lf>Petalaces a little, huh?
<string>I thought you'd take longer to get used to<lf>'em, you being a new hunter and all, but it<lf>looks like y'know your way round 'em already.
<string>Keep doin' what you're doin', Squirt.<lf>No doubt your new 'n' improved Petalaces<lf>will help with that! Bwahaha!
<string>Heh, about time!
<string>Ah, <PL>!<lf>Rare to see you without a Petalace<lf>on your arm these days, ain't it?
<string>Since they seem to be provin' helpful<lf>to you, how about a li'l upgrade?
<string>This'll be the last time, though. You've gone<lf>and made yourself a top-notch hunter. You<lf>don't need Ol' Fugen tryin' to help you out.
<string>It looks like you haven't collected every<lf>kind of Petalace out there just yet, but hey,<lf>you can do so whenever the fancy takes ya.
<string>Alright, off you go then, Squirt—on to<lf>greater hunts, greater heights, and<lf>greater honors! Now get to it! Bwahaha!
<string>Hey, I got somethin' for ya!
<string>I bet the thought of a REAL challenge<lf>sets that hunter's soul of yours on fire!<lf>And do I got a challenge for you!
<string>We can't let those skills of yours<lf>go to waste now. Gotta keep movin'.<lf>And, of course, I mean movin' UP!
<string>I've been looking for someone that's<lf>got that fire burnin' hot inside 'em.<lf>This quest ain't for the faint of heart.
<string>Ain't nothin' run of the mill 'bout it.<lf>Just like you! And that's why I called<lf>ya over!
<string>I already have a special Petalace<lf>prepared as a reward. Now get to it!<lf>Bwahaha!
<string>Hey, I got somethin' for ya!
<string>Well, I'll be...! <PL>!<lf>You've got the look of an expert<lf>hunter now, ya know that, Squirt?
<string>Since you've taken out Narwa and breezed<lf>right through every quest out there,<lf>I thought it was time to up the challenge.
<string>Over in the Arena, we've got a <COLS RED>Rajang</COL>,<lf>a <COL RED>Bazelgeuse</COL>, and <COL RED>Magnamalo</COL> waiting<lf>to dance with ya!
<string>This fight's gonna be brutal—even<lf>for YOU! But I got faith in ya!
<string>And besides, all of Kamura will go Congalala<lf>if you come out victorious. You don't wanna<lf>disappoint 'em, do ya? Now get to it! Bwahaha!
<string>Hey, I got somethin' for ya!
<string>Good to see ya, <PL>!<lf>How's the huntin' life treating you?
<string>There's somethin' I'd like you to do—<lf>On top of your normal monster-huntin'<lf>duties, that is.
<string>If ya ever hear of any villager havin'<lf>trouble, I want you to lend 'em an ear.<lf>If you can help, lend 'em a hand too.
<string>I know it's all of a sudden and all,<lf>but don't worry, I got something<lf>nice and easy to get ya used to it.
<string>I need you to bring me somethin'.<lf>Think you can do that? Come back<lf>and see me when you're ready.
<string>All done? Great!
<string>Ah, Squirt! Completed my quest already,<lf>have ya? You have my thanks. Mmmmm,<lf>smells delicious! Bwahaha!
<string>Now that ya helped me, I got another little<lf>favor to ask ya. You know everyone is doin'<lf>their own little thing to help Kamura out.
<string>But sometimes they need a helpin' hand.<lf>A well-armed one, if ya know what I mean!<lf>Bwahahaha! *ahem*
<string>How 'bout lendin' one to your fellow citizens if<lf>you happen on the chance. After all, strengthenin'<lf>relationships strengethens Kamura.
<string>Hey, I got somethin' for ya!
<string>How's it goin', Squirt? That fire for<lf>the hunt still burnin' bright within ya?<lf>GOOD!
<string>Seems like you're not the only one. Feels<lf>like the whole village is "fired up"! Bwahaha!<lf>*ahem* Guessin' you must of inspired 'em!
<string>But that also means they're more likely<lf>to hit a snag sooner. I hope you're there<lf>to help 'em out when that happens!
<string>That said, we won't take your efforts<lf>for granted—I'll be giving you a special<lf>reward in return.
<string>I only ask that you make yourself<lf>available around town and lend<lf>a hand when you can.
<string>All done? Great!
<string>Well, well! I've heard you've been<lf>helpin' out around town.
<string>Kamura is like one big family. And when you<lf>help out the people of Kamura, you're helping<lf>out all of Kamura! You remember that.
<string>Now about your reward. I've asked the smithies<lf>to offer you some equipment that'll remind you<lf>of Kamura. Keep it up now!
<string>Hey, I got somethin' for ya!
<string>Ah, <PL>!<lf>Workin' hard as ever hard, I see!
<string>Are you makin' good use of the Buddy Plaza?<lf>Iori, Kogarashi, and our foreign guests have<lf>a lot to offer there.
<string>I'm hopin' I can ask you to offer them one thing:<lf>Hire as many Buddies as you can. Ain't much of<lf>a Buddy Plaza if it ain't filled with Buddies!
<string>Plus, you'll be needin' as many Buddies as you<lf>can get your hands on. Different situations will<lf>call for different Buddies. That's a fact.
<string>And don't think your efforts will go unrewarded.<lf>Nope! I've prepared somethin' real special.<lf>Well, get to it! Bwahahaha!
<string>All done? Great!
<string>Now THAT'S what I call a Buddy Plaza.<lf>It's overflowin' with Buddies and we're<lf>overflowin' with gratitude!
<string>Don't think I've seen Iori this happy in ages.<lf>He's got his hands full with paws! Warms the<lf>heart...it really does. Bwahaha! *ahem*
<string>What's more, there's now some Kamura-<lf>themed Buddy Equipment over at the armory.<lf>Go check it out when you get a chance.
<string>You've been busy!
<string>Ah, just the hunter I wanted to see! Why? Well,<lf>lately, you've been goin' through quests faster<lf>than Hinoa goes through a box of dango!
<string><NOTE:211>So here, I'm givin' ya this:<lf>a Kamura Ticket.
<string>A little somethin' to thank you for all you<lf>do for the village. Consider it a gift from<lf>everyone here. Keep up the good work!
<string>You've been busy!
<string>Ah, just the hunter I wanted to see! Why? Well,<lf>lately, you've been goin' through quests faster<lf>than Hinoa goes through a box of dango!
<string>So, on behalf of the rest of the villagers,<lf>here's a thank-you Kamura Ticket from<lf>me. Keep up the good work, Squirt!
