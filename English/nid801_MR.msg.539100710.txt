<string>What an ominous turn of events...
<string><NPC:801><CAM:0><VO:SER><LOOK:801,CAM>Ah, Hunter.<lf>I was waiting for your return.
<string>I have received a letter from my home<lf>country that contains somewhat troubling<lf>news.
<string>The letter was sent by my sister and in it<lf>she details how monsters from the Kingdom<lf>have started invading neighboring territories.
<string>My sister belongs to the Knights of the<lf>Royal Order and has assembled a research<lf>team to combat this threat.
<string>Ideally the research team would halt their<lf>advance before the village, but—
<string>It's only a matter of time before some of<lf>these monsters reach Kamura's shores,<lf>if they have not already...
<string>Elder Fugen has already been brought<lf>up to speed, however, as you are the<lf>defender of this village...
<string>I would like you to be part of the discussion<lf>on this matter. Come, let us go speak with<lf>Elder Fugen. There isn't a moment to waste.
<string><NPC:1><CAM:1><LOOK:801,001>There you are, Squirt! We've been waitin' for ya!
<string><SCAM:2><FACE:SER><VO:SER>Alright, Utsushi. Fill us in.
<string><NPC:803><VO:SER><LOOK:801,803>I'm sure you've already heard<lf>the not-so-gnarly news from Rondine.
<string>Monsters from the Kingdom are starting to<lf>invade other territories. And looks like Kamura<lf>has made the list of "other territories"...
<string>We've just received word that a <COLS RED>Daimyo<lf>Hermitaur</COL> has been spotted in the<lf>Shrine Ruins. That's a first for this region.
<string><NPC:801><VO:SER><LOOK:803,801>Merciful heavens! We're already too late!?
<string><LOOK:001,801>To think the turmoil of my homeland would<lf>jeopardize the safety of this village...<lf>How can I even begin to apologize—
<string><NPC:1><LOOK:801,001>Take it easy, Rondine! None of us could<lf>have anticipated the monsters branchin'<lf>out, much less this quickly.
<string>The movements of monsters constantly<lf>exceed our understandin'. We barely knew<lf>anything about the Rampage for years.
<string><LOOK:001,CAM,803,CAM>At any rate, Squirt, we're gonna need you to give<lf>our guest in the Shrine Ruins a proper Kamura<lf>welcome. Minoto has the job lined up for you.
<string><LOOK:001,801,803,001>Utsushi, you've got your own mission. And<lf>Rondine, let us know next time you hear<lf>from that research team. Now, go get to it!
<string><NPC:1><CAM:1><FACE:SER><VO:SER><LOOK:806,001>First a Daimyo Hermitaur, and now<lf>we got other monsters showin' their<lf>ugly mugs...
<string><SCAM:5><LOOK:001,806,801,806>In any case, we appreciate the backup.<lf>So you're Rondine's sister, huh?
<string><NPC:806><SCAM:3><VO:SIL><LOOK:806,001>Yes, honorable Elder. <COLS RED>Dame Fiorayne</COL>,<lf>knight of the Royal Order, at your service.
<string><NPC:801><SCAM:5><VO:SER>Dearest Sister, it appears the monsters<lf>from our homeland are invading this<lf>region at an unprecedented speed.
<string><NPC:1>These monsters' behavior... You think<lf>that <COL RED>crater</COL> has anythin' to do with it?
<string><NPC:806><SCAM:3>As expected of the village elder, you<lf>have commendable insight.
<string><NPC:1><SCAM:5><LOOK:001,CAM><PL>. Most of the villagers<lf>aren't aware of this, but fifty years ago,<lf>the Kingdom suffered its own calamity...
<string><LOOK:801,CAM>You see, this massive hole opened up<lf>far away from Kamura. In a coastal region<lf>right outside the Kingdom's domain.
<string>Because of its proximity, it fell under royal<lf>jurisdiction. But there was another reason<lf>why the Kingdom got involved...
<string><NPC:806><SCAM:3><VO:SER><LOOK:806,CAM>The Kingdom got involved because a similar<lf>phenomenon had occurred centuries before<lf>in the capital. The ground gave way and...
<string>The elder dragon, <COLS RED>Malzeno</COL>, emerged and<lf>nearly brought our precious Kingdom to the<lf>brink of ruin. Then it simply disappeared.
<string>This disaster repeated itself fifty years ago.<lf>A crater formed, Malzeno emerged, calamity<lf>ensued, and then it disappeared again.
<string>Its whereabouts remain unknown...
<string>Fearing its return, the Royal Order established<lf>an outpost in an old fort to monitor the crater.<lf>However, in light of recent events...
<string><LOOK:001,806,801,806>Construction has begun to rebuild the fort.<lf>We've even given it a proper name. <COLS RED>Elgado</COL>.<lf>A grand name is it not?
<string><NPC:1><SCAM:5>So you think these invadin' monsters<lf>are behavin' like this because ol' Malzeno<lf>is back?
<string><NPC:806><SCAM:3><LOOK:806,001>Too soon to say; the crater shows no<lf>signs of activity. Still, that hypothesis<lf>is the basis of our team's expedition.
<string>We knights vow to protect our fair Kingdom<lf>from any threat. If it has returned, we shall<lf>lay down our lives for the cause!
<string><NPC:1><SCAM:5>"Lay down your lives," huh?
<string><LOOK:001,CAM>Hmmm... Right, <PL>.
<string><LOOK:801,CAM>I've got a new mission for you.
<string>I need you to work with Fiorayne and the<lf>Kingdom. Help them resolve this situation.
<string>This goes beyond Kamura. If the monsters<lf>keep actin' up, every ecosystem out there<lf>is in jeopardy.
<string>The Rampage is Kamura's problem, but this<lf>crater business affects all surroundin' regions.<lf>I'm makin' it your top priority!
<string><NPC:806><SCAM:3><TURN:806,CAM><LOOK:806,CAM><VO:NOR>Oh! Y-You're sending <PL> to<lf>the Kingdom!? We are in your debt.
<string>As a knight of the Order, I must show<lf>my respect and gratitude for the Elder's<lf>decision to lend us your strength.
<string><NPC:801><SCAM:5>I pray that the flame of Kamura will prove to<lf>be the light of hope that the Kingdom needs!<lf>But do take care of yourself...and my sister.
<string><NPC:806><SCAM:3>Well then, call upon me once your<lf>preparations are complete.
<string><NPC:1><SCAM:4><VO:SER><TURN:001,CAM>One more thing before ya go... While we were<lf>fightin' with the Rampage fifty years ago, the<lf>Kingdom had their own mess to deal with.
<string>We were all so busy lookin' out for our<lf>own necks that we didn't even stop to<lf>help each other...
<string>This is the chance of a lifetime, Squirt.<lf>I'm puttin' my trust in you to make it right.
<string><VO:NOR>Now you're gonna experience a lot of new<lf>and bizarre things, maybe even a little<lf>culture shock, but it'll be good for ya!
<string>Alright, Squirt! Go out there and show 'em<lf>what a hunter of Kamura is made of!
