<string>Did you meet Meowster Hamon's new<lf>ap-purr-entice from the Kingdom?<lf>She was so nice!
<string>And talented too! Meowster Hamon was<lf>im-purr-essed with how fast she picked<lf>up his techniques! Said she was a natural!
<string>We became really good fur-iends too!<lf>But before I knew it, she was gone...
<string>She did say she'd come back and visit!<lf>And she purr-omised to keep in touch!<lf>I already sent her a letter!
<string>I hope she can read my paw-writing...<lf>Do you think she'll write back!?<lf>Oh, I hope so!
<string>Tails of your deeds over in the Kingdom<lf>are already making their way back to<lf>the village!
<string>I have no idea what's going on, but it<lf>sounds like you're investigating some<lf>purr-etty scary meownsters.
<string>At least they sound scary to me. You've<lf>been up against so many meownsters<lf>I bet you're not afur-aid of anything now!
<string>I heard you can buy Bunny Dango<lf>in Elgado! Is it true, <PL>?
<string>Meow! That's amazing! I don't know what<lf>I'd eat if I didn't have Bunny Dango...
<string>Are they as popular as they are here?<lf>What am I saying, of course they!<lf>No one can resist that delicious fur-lavor!
<string>Mew... All this dango talk is making<lf>my tummy growl... Wanna go get<lf>some with me?
<string><PL>! <PL>!<lf>I got a reply! I got a reply from Minayle.<lf>She sent me a letter!
<string>You're so lucky. You get to see her every<lf>day. I told her I wish I could work with her<lf>over at the Meowtpost...
<string>But she said I'm lucky because I get to<lf>work in Kamura with Meowster Hamon.<lf>Do you think so?
<string>She calls him a genius with god-like<lf>abilities. Is he really that amazing?
<string>Well, if Minayle says so then it must<lf>be true! Either way, I need to finish<lf>my work so I can write her back!
<string>The other day, Komitsu asked us<lf>to fix up her old pot that she uses<lf>to make candy apples.
<string>Meowster Hamon said I could take care<lf>of it, so I worked my tail off and now it<lf>looks brand mew!
<string>Komitsu was so happy with my work<lf>that she gave me some candy apples.
<string>And her candy apples are so good!<lf>A purr-fect snack when your tummy<lf>starts to growl.
<string>*growl* Oh, and speak of the Deviljho!<lf>That was my tummy telling me that<lf>it's snack time!
<string>Welcome back, <PL>!<lf>It's great to see you again.<lf>How's the Kingdom treatin' nya?
<string>It's always good to see you again.<lf>You know we worry about you a lot<lf>when you're not here!
<string>It's always a huge relief to see that you're<lf>OK. Like that same relief you feel when<lf>you dip your paws into a nice warm bath!
