<string>Hey, <PL>! What's up?<lf>Want some rice balls?
<string>Hey! Aren't you hanging out with Hinoa?
<string>You're gonna get in trouble if you don't<lf>go back to her! You can come stuff your<lf>face here any time.
<string>You're a real hunter now? You definitely look<lf>pretty slick carrying round that big weapon.<lf>Can I hold it? No...? Aw, man...
<string>When Komitsu saw you earlier, she was like,<lf>"Wow, <PL> looks soooooo cool!"
<string>I guess she only digs hunters...<lf>What's the big deal? Chefs are cool too.<lf>And I'm always making rice balls for her—
<string>Uhhh, I mean—!
<string>N-Not that I care! I make rice balls<lf>for everybody, that's my job!<lf>There's nothing special about her!
<string>My mom runs the vegetable shop next door.<lf>She's always giving me a hard time.
<string>"Stop staring at Komitsu and<lf>make your rice balls!" she says.
<string>I'm not staring at anyone! I just need<lf>to stretch my neck sometimes, a-and<lf>Komitsu just happens to be there, OK?
<string>The Rampage is on its way, huh? Loads of<lf>monsters are gonna attack. Something bad<lf>happened to the village a long time ago, too.
<string>If they come again, we'll have to run.<lf>Komitsu can be pretty hopeless, so I'll<lf>prob'ly have to grab her hand and—
<string>Uhhh, I mean—!
<string>It's n-not like THAT! Y'know, if somethin'<lf>happens, you gotta help the slow ones,<lf>and Komitsu can't even run ten yards.
<string>...Wait, what am I gettin' worried for?<lf>If you keep smackin' those monsters<lf>down, it won't come to that. H-Heh...!
<string>Phew! We managed to deliver the ingredients<lf>for the Bunny Dango on time.
<string>Komitsu loves those Bunny Dango.<lf>When she eats them with Hinoa, they<lf>always look like they're havin' a great—
<string>Uhhh, I mean—!
<string>H-Hold on a sec! I just saw them that<lf>one time! Anybody would remember<lf>a nice moment like that, right!?
<string>...Wait, what am I stressin' for?<lf>I'm sure you appreciate a good Bunny<lf>Dango too. Right, <PL>?
<string>Did ya hear? Gh-Ghosts and stuff are<lf>appearing in the Shrine Ruins.<lf>Kinda sp-spooky, r-right?
<string>Uhhh, I mean—!
<string>D-Did I say spooky?<lf>I'm n-not spooked! No way!<lf>I ain't afraid of no ghost!
<string>...Wait, what am I stressin' for?<lf>You're a full-blown hunter. I'm sure<lf>you can handle a few...gh-ghosts.
<string>Those Buddies really caused Iori<lf>a buncha trouble! But luckily<lf>everyone got through OK.
<string>Y'know, when Komitsu has leftover<lf>apples an' stuff, she takes 'em all<lf>down to the Buddy Plaza.
<string>Isn't that nice? Komitsu is so kind<lf>to everyone. Why do I end up doing<lf>all that mean stuff to her—?
<string>Uhhh, I mean—!
<string>I-I'm not the mean one here!<lf>It's... It's all her fault!
<string>If she came over and talked to ME once<lf>in a while, maybe I wouldn't have to say<lf>and do that stuff to get her attention!
<string>Did ya hear? Gh-Ghosts and stuff are<lf>appearing in the Shrine Ruins.<lf>Kinda sp-spooky, r-right?
<string>Uhhh, I mean—!
<string>D-Did I say spooky?<lf>I'm n-not spooked! No way!<lf>I ain't afraid of no ghost!
<string>...Wait, what am I stressin' for?<lf>You're a full-blown hunter. I'm sure<lf>you can handle a few...gh-ghosts.
<string>The Rampage is almost here, right?<lf>Well, we're just kids, so we have to<lf>stay at home and stay out of trouble.
<string>The defenders going up to the Stronghold<lf>were all saying stuff like, "We've got<lf>to protect our precious Komitsu!"
<string>Yeah, yeah; less talking, more fighting!<lf>That's exactly why I'm getting secret<lf>archery lessons from Hinoa—
<string>Uhhh, I mean—!
<string>I'm learning how to shoot because<lf>it's cool! It definitely has nothing to<lf>do with Komitsu! No way!
<string>Yeah, so I heard that Yomogi was almost<lf>eaten by some huge, terrifying monster?<lf>That's what she says anyway...
<string>...What? Magnamalo? Oh, the one that was<lf>chowing down on other monsters in the<lf>Rampage? Yeah, Gramps told me about it.
<string>So, a monster was behind all the ghost<lf>sightings. Well, Komitsu is pretty timid;<lf>she'd be scared of either one—
<string>Uhhh, I mean—!
<string>N-Not like I care! Doesn't matter to me if<lf>Komitsu is a big scaredy-cat or whatever!
<string>I'll chase off all those nasty beasts<lf>whether she's scared of them or not!<lf>No problem!
<string>Mr. Hamon designed some kind of<lf>machine to help us fight Magnamalo.<lf>And now it's set up in the Stronghold.
<string>He explained how it works but I couldn't<lf>understand any of it. All I got was blah<lf>blah blah, Bishaten parts, blah blah blah.
<string>When everyone was moving it to<lf>the Stronghold, I heard that<lf>Komitsu helped out, too.
<string>He told her she did a really good<lf>job helping and after that she had<lf>the sweetest smile—
<string>Uhhh, I mean—!
<string>N-Not like I care! She can be happy,<lf>she can be sad, it's all the same to me!
<string>I certainly don't think about what<lf>it would be like to put that kind of<lf>smile on her face. Nope! Not one bit!
<string>You're going out to hunt Magnamalo?<lf>Y'know, Komitsu is really rooting<lf>for ya.
<string>What the heck! That time I brought all<lf>those rice balls for the defenders,<lf>I didn't hear a single word from her—
<string>Uhhh, I mean—!
<string>N-Not that I care! I don't care who or<lf>what she cheers for! And I definitely<lf>don't want her cheering for me! ...At all!
<string>Even if she doesn't say anything, as<lf>long as Komitsu is there I can go<lf>all out! I don't need any stupid praise.
<string>You took down Magnamalo?<lf>I'm impressed. You're becoming<lf>a real top-tier hunter, huh?
<string>Looks like Komitsu is head over heels<lf>for you, <PL>. Well,<lf>keep up the good work.
<string>But some day, I will overtake you!<lf>You may be the hotshot right now,<lf>but I'm just biding my time.
<string>I dunno if I'll ever make it out of the<lf>shop, but I'm gonna try my best, and one<lf>day Komitsu will look at me in awe!
<string>...B-But not like THAT!
<string>She'll be in awe of my strength and<lf>success, and the stories about me.<lf>Love has nothing to do with it!
<string>Hey, <PL>. Do you ever<lf>find that you're hungry, but you<lf>can't bring yourself to eat anything?
<string>Sometimes I'll go with Komitsu<lf>for Bunny Dango over at<lf>Hinoa's place, but...
<string>Even though my stomach's rumbling,<lf>I can't eat a single bite! It's so strange.<lf>What's up with that?
<string>What's that? My stomach is full<lf>of butterflies?
<string>Did a monster hit you over the head!?<lf>Are you trying to say that I get nervous<lf>being next to Komitsu!? That's stupid!
<string>Oh, I get it! I must be resonating with<lf>Komitsu's joy when she eats those<lf>dango. That's why I feel full.
<string>There! See? It's got nothing to do with<lf>love or butterflies or any of that junk!
<string>Yo, <PL>, are you going<lf>to the Hub? That place is kinda, like...<lf>a place for grownups to hang out.
<string>Because they serve, y'know, drinks.<lf>Grownup drinks... Alcohol, ya big goof!<lf>That's why kids can't go in.
<string>When I'm a bit older though—when I'm,<lf>like, a man—I can take Komitsu out for<lf>a drink and give her the grand tour—
<string>Uhhh, I mean—!
<string>N-Not like THAT! You think I wanna take<lf>Komitsu out on a date!? No way!
<string>Somebody has to show her around<lf>so she doesn't get lost! Yeah,<lf>she'd get lost all by herself!

<string>We just got news from the Gathering<lf>Hub that the Rampage is finally here.<lf>And they say it's really massive!
<string>This is perfect timing! Hinoa finally<lf>gave me her old bow. Now I can<lf>defend Komitsu—
<string>Uhhh, I mean—!
<string>H-Hey! D-Don't get the wrong idea! I didn't<lf>take all those archery lessons from Hinoa<lf>just to protect Komitsu. Are you crazy!?
<string>I learned so I could protect the shop!<lf>...Wait, what are you still doing here?<lf>You need to go and fight!
<string>As long as you don't let anything slip<lf>past, I won't have to get my bow out<lf>for Komitsu or anyone else.
<string>Hinoa had a real rough time with all that<lf>resonating stuff. I'm glad she's OK now.
<string>Komitsu really loves Hinoa, y'know,<lf>so she was bawling her eyes out<lf>right up until she got better.
<string>That dumb monster! Not only did it<lf>hurt Hinoa, but it made Komitsu<lf>cry too. Gah! It makes me so angry!
<string>Y'know how Komitsu is always staring<lf>off into space, right? The other day,<lf>I crept up from behind to scare her.
<string>Except this time, she wasn't spacing<lf>out at all. She was searching the sky,<lf>looking for the monster that hurt Hinoa.
<string>I felt sooo bad about it afterwards.<lf>Ugh! Why am I such a big dummy!?<lf>I'm sorry, Komitsu...
<string>Y'know, ever since Komitsu started skygazing<lf>for that monster, I started doing the same.
<string>Around Komitsu, it's like I can't help<lf>myself. I just say mean things. So I<lf>thought, "Maybe I can be nice this way."
<string>Not that I'm doing this for Komitsu.<lf>This is all for Hinoa's sake, of course.<lf>...Wh-Why are you looking at me like that?
<string>If you take out Ibushi, the Rampage will<lf>be over, we won't have to worry about<lf>Hinoa...there's like, no downside!
<string>So go kick some butt, <PL>!<lf>Komitsu is always so worried lately, and<lf>I just want to see her cute smile—
<string>Uhhh, I mean—!
<string>Wh-Why are you always bringing Komitsu<lf>into this!? What do you mean I mentioned<lf>her first!?
<string>People just wanna see their friends happy,<lf>right? That's totally normal. I'm just a<lf>nice guy, OK? Don't give that look!
<string>Hey, aren't we done with the Rampage<lf>now that you've driven off Ibushi?<lf>Why are we still sending people out?
<string>From where I stand, as long as Komitsu<lf>is smiling again, we've done the job—
<string>Uhhh, I mean—!
<string>Wh-What does Komitsu's smile have to do with<lf>the Rampage?
<string>Nothing! Except that this part of the<lf>village would be real gloomy without her<lf>laugh to fill the air, don't ya think?
<string>Th-Thunder Serpent Narwa?<lf>Aw jeez, ANOTHER ONE!?
<string>If you take out this one, the Rampage<lf>will be over for real this time...r-right?
<string>It's kinda confusing. Even Komitsu<lf>said she doesn't really get it either.
<string>So you're going out to take on Narwa?<lf>Hinoa and Minoto are both saying it's<lf>a real beast of a dragon.
<string><PL>... I have a huge secret!<lf>SUPER HUGE! I haven't told this to anyone.<lf>yet. Nobody at all. But I trust you.
<string>Y'see, the thing is...<lf>I...I, uh... I really, like...
<string>I have a m-m-m-massive crush on Komitsu!
<string>If you make it back in one piece, I'll tell<lf>Komitsu how I feel... So, like... Uh...<lf>Hurry back, OK?
<string>It could be too early to celebrate,<lf>but everyone can rest a little easier<lf>with you around, <PL>.
<string>What's that? Did I tell Komitsu<lf>all about my undying love for her?
<string>Erm...I don't know what you're talking<lf>about! I haven't thought about that<lf>girl in like a week. Maybe two! Yep.
<string>Ohhh! You mean the crush thing? That was just<lf>a little joke to raise your spirits! Hahaha...<lf>ha...ha... What, you thought I was serious?
<string>It looks like a bunch of big ol' monsters<lf>started showing up all over the place.
<string>Is it 'cause of Ibushi and Narwa?<lf>You've sure got a big job on<lf>your hands, <PL>.
<string>You should take a break once<lf>in a while and talk to Komitsu.<lf>She'd really like that.
<string>What's that? You think *I* should talk to her?
<string>N-No can do! I'm too busy with the shop,<lf>making food for the defenders! I-I don't<lf>have time to be slacking off, y'know!
<string><PL>... You gotta come back safe,<lf>OK? I-I mean it.
<string>Whenever I see Komitsu, she's always teary-<lf>eyed. She says she's worried about you.
<string>She cries even while making her candy<lf>apples... And says she wants to give you<lf>some when you get back.
<string>That's why you gotta come back safe—<lf>promise me. I...I gotta see Komitsu's big,<lf>stupid smile again...!
<string>Thank goodness you came back OK.<lf>Komitsu's been smiling real big all day.<lf>Seeing that makes me real happy too...
<string>Uhhh, I mean—!
<string>N-Not just Komitsu! I meant to say that<lf>seeing everyone smiling made me happy!
<string>I'd be happy as long as she's there,<lf>even if she's not smiling! 'Cause...<lf>Komitsu's very existence makes me happy!
<string>Since the village's gotten all hustle and<lf>bustle, Komitsu's been really happy. The way<lf>she just beams when she works now... Heh...
<string>...Uhhh, I mean—!
<string>B-B-Because the village is busier now, my<lf>rice ball stand is makin' BANK, and—<lf>naturally—I'm real happy about it!
<string>I ALSO just happened to notice Komitsu's<lf>happy too! It's not like seeing her doing<lf>well is making me smile or anything!
<string>My mom runs the vegetable shop next door.<lf>She's always giving me a hard time.
<string>"Stop staring at Komitsu and<lf>make your rice balls!" she says.
<string>I'm not staring at anyone! I just need<lf>to stretch my neck sometimes, a-and<lf>Komitsu just happens to be there, OK?

<string>I'm not staring at anyone! I just need<lf>to stretch my neck sometimes, a-and<lf>Komitsu just happens to be there, OK?
<string>Sometimes I go over to Komitsu's<lf>shop with a box of rice balls for her.
<string>Everybody loves getting free food! It<lf>makes Komitsu happy, and she usually<lf>gives me a candy apple in return.
<string>Hahaha...<lf>...What?<lf>No, that's the end of the story.

<string>Hahaha...<lf>...What?<lf>No, that's the end of the story.
<string>A little while ago, Komitsu came<lf>up to me and said "Seihaku, do you<lf>like me? Or do you hate me?"
<string>I was so shocked that I had to get out<lf>of there... Next thing I knew, I was<lf>laying in my bed the next morning.
<string>You've gotta help me out here!<lf>How the heck do you answer<lf>a question like that?
<string>There's no right answer! Whatever I say,<lf>things will never go back to the way<lf>they were before. It's messing me up!

<string>*sigh*
<string>Yeah, I get it, Mom. I'll be good.
