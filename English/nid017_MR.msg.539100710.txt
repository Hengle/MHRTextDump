<string>Oh, Chief! *munch munch*<lf>Is it true? *munch*<lf>You're going to the Kingdom's outpost?
<string>So you're the strongest hunter in<lf>Kamura AND the Kingdom!? Whoa...<lf>*munch munch munch*
<string>But, hey, I've been keepin' up with my<lf>trainin' too, ya know! I've been eatin'<lf>and sleepin' more than ever!
<string>So, *munch* I never realized this before,<lf>but Rondine is actually a knight!?<lf>I should have known... *munch munch*
<string>I mean, she carries herself so gracefully,<lf>duh. That's, like, rule number one of bein'<lf>a knight! Now to learn rule number two...
<string>Hey, how long have you known about this?<lf>I wish you would have told me sooner!
<string>...So, what are the other knights like?<lf>Are they much different from hunters?<lf>C'mon, Chief! Spill the beans!
<string>*munch munch*<lf>So the other day I was doin' a mock<lf>trainin' session with Master Utsushi.
<string>He was teachin' me about Kingdom<lf>monsters, and he did this crazy impression<lf>of this monster called "Garangolm."
<string>It was the coolest thing I'd ever seen!<lf>It was just like the real thing!
<string>I mean... I've never seen the real thing...<lf>B-But I'm sure it was just like that!
<string>Have you hunted one before? WHOA!<lf>You have!? That's so cool. I want to be<lf>JUST like you one day! *munch munch*
<string>Chief! Chief! Master Utsushi has been<lf>tellin' me all about your hunts in the<lf>Kingdom! You have some crazy stories!
<string>He told me about how you hunted a<lf>Blood Orange Bishaten and an Anjanath!<lf>Wow, Chief! You're so cool!
<string>But the coolest story was about you huntin'<lf>a Lunagaron! Master Utsushi's impression<lf>was so awesome...and scary...
<string>Chiiiiiief! Welcome back! So you've<lf>really been kickin' some monster butt<lf>over in the Kingdom, huh?
<string>Ever since you left the village, you<lf>keep gettin' stronger and stronger!<lf>You must have so many cool stories!
<string>But you know what, one day I'M gonna<lf>have all the cool stories! But first, I need<lf>to eat plenty of dango to get stronger.
<string>OK! Today's target is to match how many<lf>servings Hinoa had after breakfast. I CAN<lf>DO THIS!
<string>Hey, Chief! You're back! *munch*<lf>Gotten used to workin' out in Elgado, yet?<lf>*munch munch*
<string>How about a little rest while you're in town?<lf>I'm gonna go take a nap in Doctor Zenchi's<lf>spot while he's helpin' with sales.
<string>He says I gotta keep his spot warm while<lf>he's gone. Besides, part of trainin' is to<lf>sleep plenty, right!?
<string>You can't be the best Chief you can be,<lf>if you don't get your rest! At least, that's<lf>what Master Utsushi tells me.
