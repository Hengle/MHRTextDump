<string>Meowdy, <PL>!<lf>Gettin' ready to leave?
<string>Keep workin' hard so you can<lf>be the best hunter you can be!<lf>I'll be cheerin' for ya!
<string>So Elgado is the name of the Kingdom's<lf>meowtpost, huh? I heard it's right next to<lf>"O-shun"...
<string>Kajika told me that all of the fish in<lf>the "O-shun" are completely diffur-ent<lf>from the fish around here!
<string>I hope I can see the "O-shun" someday...<lf>Maybe if I visit Elgado I can!
<string>You wouldn't happen to have anything<lf>you need me to deliver there, do ya?<lf>Hint, hint!
<string>Meowdy, <PL>!<lf>How's Kingdom life treatin' ya?
<string>I heard they've got you huntin' all the<lf>fur-ighteningly fur-ocious meownsters<lf>out there.
<string>Must be nothing to you meow, since<lf>that's all you do. I can relate.
<string>For me it's, "another day, another<lf>delivery." For you it's, "another day,<lf>another meownster."
<string>Just got some mew snacks in from<lf>Hobashira. I've never seen them before.<lf>Maybe they're fur-om the Kingdom?
<string>If they're a hit with customers, maybe<lf>I'll keep 'em in stock.
<string>Of course, I gotta try 'em out fur-st! <lf>But not until I finish my deliveries...<lf>Just a few more trips to go.
<string>If I could carry it all at once, I'd be done<lf>by meow... Well, at least I have snack<lf>time to look forward to!
<string>Meowdy, <PL>!<lf>Welcome back! Are ya in town long?
<string>You know, it's always great to see<lf>you back in the village.
<string>Kinda strange not havin' you around<lf>all the time... It's taken some gettin'<lf>used to, that's fur sure!
<string>Anymew, if you have some time later,<lf>maybe we can have dinner or go fur<lf>a drink in the Hub?
