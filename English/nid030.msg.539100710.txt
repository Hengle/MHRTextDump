<string>Well, if it isn't <PL>!<lf>What's up?
<string>Is that Hinoa over there waiting for you?<lf>Kinda rude to just leave her hanging there...
<string><PL>?<lf>Wow, you've changed so much I hardly<lf>even recognized you.
<string>Oh! A hunter now, are ya? Even got<lf>a fancy weapon too! It suits ya!
<string>Wonder what Pops would say if he saw ya.<lf>He's off wandering around somewhere like<lf>always. I'll have to send him a letter.
<string>Sorry, no time for chit-chat. Gotta haul<lf>this over to the steelworks pronto. Later!
<string>What's up, <PL>?<lf>Off to hunt?
<string>I'm just haulin' cargo like always.<lf>The days may end, but the stuff<lf>comin' into the harbor don't stop.
<string>If I don't deliver them quick,<lf>this place will be nothing but<lf>a mountain of boxes.
<string>Hey, <PL>, great timing!<lf>I was just about to get going!
<string>I told Pops that you're a hunter now,<lf>and he was tickled pink! Even sent us<lf>a GIGANTIC hunk of meat to celebrate!
<string>But, uh...the box doesn't say "what kind"<lf>of meat it is.
<string>It's like, weirdly watery and soft,<lf>kinda bloated, and the color—Jeez.<lf>Plus the smell... It's..."unique."
<string>But, uh, anyway.<lf>You gonna eat it?
<string>Me and Ikari distribute all of the cargo<lf>that comes into the harbor.
<string>Ikari drops everything down on<lf>the docks first, then sorts out my<lf>portion before runnin' off with his.
<string>He knows I gotta go further out with my<lf>deliveries, so he preps it all for me.
<string>It's a lifesaver, since havin' to think<lf>about every package in a long list of<lf>deliveries along the way wastes time.
<string>My job's to safely get things where they<lf>need to go, and that makes people happy.<lf>All I gotta worry about are my muscles!
<string>Folks around here are kind. A lotta times,<lf>I'll carry a package for them, and they'll<lf>give me stuff out of thanks.
<string>I love it. It's just that, a full-grown<lf>man carrying around a candy apple<lf>on the job is kinda embarrassing...
<string>Can you blame me though? No way I can<lf>refuse sweets from little Komitsu!
<string>Have you seen her little puppy eyes?<lf>No wonder Seihaku goes gaga over her.
<string>The Rampage is coming, huh? I ain't<lf>all that worried. Everyone's prepared<lf>for it and all.
<string>Although, as it draws near, the deliveries<lf>are practically doubling. Gonna need some<lf>new shoes if this keeps up!
<string>Hey, speaking of cargo, the other day<lf>I got a huge package in from Pops.<lf>It was full of good-luck charms.
<string>He's not even here and he's more<lf>worried than I am about this whole<lf>mess. What can I say, he's a worrier.
<string>Still, what's he thinking, stuffing all<lf>these charms into this big ol' box?<lf>That DOES kinda make me nervous.
<string>But hey, I got enough charms to ward off<lf>this Rampage and every future Rampage<lf>until the end of time! Hahaha!
<string>Magnamalo... I think that's the same<lf>monster from fifty years ago that Pops<lf>goes on and on about.
<string>He says Master Hamon was a big player<lf>in the fight against it back then.
<string>Pops tells the story whenever he gets<lf>boozed up. Except each time he tells it,<lf>it gets more and more absurd.
<string>Last time I heard it, it went that HE<lf>was the one who drove it off. Come<lf>on, it was Master Hamon, you loon!
<string>His drunk stories are about half—<lf>no, a quarter true, maybe.
<string>Man, Pops better not be drinking and<lf>telling weird stories to strangers.<lf>Dang, now I'm worried about him...
<string>Master Hamon's contraption is<lf>mind-bogglingly cool.
<string>Ya know, I haul stuff over there from<lf>time to time. Each time I do, I see it's<lf>a little closer to completion.
<string>Sometimes I deliver stuff there just to<lf>see how it's coming along. Hahaha!
<string>You're finally gonna hunt Magnamalo?
<string>Pops is cheering you on too. Even sent<lf>some "go-get-em juice" or something<lf>for you along with this letter.
<string>I'm, uh...not so sure you should drink that<lf>stuff before going off to hunt Magnamalo!<lf>I know I wouldn't...
<string>H-Hey, don't worry about it! I'll just tell<lf>him you drank it and go pour it out in<lf>a ditch somewhere. Hahaha!
<string>You took down Magnamalo?<lf>Whoa, that's great!
<string>I can see Pops's face now. Probably has<lf>the biggest smile! I'm not sure if that's<lf>from the news or the booze though...
<string>Hey, <PL>.<lf>You like veggies, right?
<string>I brought Wakana a package earlier and<lf>she gave me a bunch of 'em as thanks.
<string>It's very generous of her, but I, uh, can't<lf>bring myself to eat them all...
<string>I mean, don't get me wrong, her greens<lf>are delicious. But it's normal if I don't like<lf>one or two veggies, right? RIGHT?
<string>...Please say you'll eat 'em.
<string>Hey, <PL>.<lf>Going to the Gathering Hub now too?
<string>I'm off to get a drink there. Drinking<lf>alone ain't the worst thing, but booze<lf>tastes better with company!
<string>In moderation, of course.
<string>Can't be bringing home all sorts of<lf>random junk like Pops does when<lf>he's had one too many.
<string>Lately, you're all Taishi talks about.
<string>At first, I had no idea who he was talking<lf>about. He just kept saying, "I wanna be<lf>just like that," over and over again.
<string>Every word outta his mouth is about how<lf>cool you are and how he looks up to ya.<lf>That and stuff about Master Utsushi.
<string>He idolizes you! Haha! Hey, having a role<lf>model to look up to's a good thing for him.<lf>And you make a fine one!
<string>*sigh* Walking around all day<lf>gets me famished.
<string>I think I had a delivery for the Tea<lf>Shop today. Maybe I'll get some<lf>Bunny Dango while I'm there.
<string>Alright, just gotta push myself<lf>a little more and I'm there!
<string>There's a BIG Rampage horde coming,<lf>you say? I hope it misses the village,<lf>but I guess it's better to be prepared.
<string>Oh, heh. On a completely different note:<lf>Pops sent me some mushrooms. They were<lf>quite tasty!
<string>I ate em' all before I knew it. I meant<lf>to leave some for Hobashira and Ikari,<lf>but... Oh well.
<string>Hey, Pops finally sent me something<lf>normal for once. Next thing you know,<lf>Felynes are gonna be sprouting wings!
<string>HAHAHA! ...W-Wait, I can't—<lf>HAHA! Oh boy, I can't stop—<lf>HAHA—laughing! HAHAHAHA!
<string>Hinoa's doing that mind thing with<lf>a monster? She looked totally<lf>normal last I saw her, though.
<string>It was Minoto who looked more affected by it...
<string>She must be really worried!<lf>She does love her sis.
<string>I didn't tell Pops about Hinoa. It'd just<lf>make him worry. Gog knows what he<lf>would send to "fix it."
<string>A lot's been going down lately.<lf>Must be hard on ya.
<string>Things've been pretty normal here;<lf>more work sometimes, less, others.
<string>Well, lately it's been crazy busy.<lf>Always more to deliver, never less.<lf>*sigh*
<string>A lot's been going down lately.<lf>Must be hard on ya.
<string>Things've been pretty normal here;<lf>more work sometimes, less, others.
<string>Well, lately it's been crazy busy.<lf>Always more to deliver, never less.<lf>*sigh*
<string>I mean, the finer points are<lf>way over my head, but...
<string>Killing this Wind Serpent thing'll end<lf>the Rampage and stop Hinoa from<lf>doing her mind bond thingy with it?
<string>Like that saying: "Kill two Kut-Ku with<lf>one stone!" That's easy to understand.
<string>And if the Rampage ends,<lf>Pops might come back to Kamura...
<string>My money's all on you now!<lf>I'm counting on ya, <PL>!
<string>Hey! good going!<lf>I knew you had it in ya.
<string>Driving off Ibushi—I mean, I never doubted you!
<string>I heard you actually did it and I was<lf>like, "Whoa, that's crazy!"
<string>Pops is psyched too! He's really<lf>been wanting to talk to ya.
<string>The Rampage is still ragin' on.<lf>Guess that means Pops won't<lf>be coming back any time soon.
<string>Oh. Hey, don't worry about it.<lf>Pops is far away right now anyway.
<string>He sent a letter along with a pretty<lf>strange mask. Looks like it's from<lf>way down south... Maybe? Yeah...
<string>I showed it to Master Utsushi, and<lf>it seems to have stirred up some<lf>creative juices in him.
<string>You going, <PL>?<lf>This serpent's way stronger than<lf>any other. That's what I heard.
<string>Stay safe out there.
<string>If you ain't looking lively when you<lf>come back, I'm gonna force you<lf>to drink Pops's mystery potion!
<string>You're seriously something else!
<string>Maybe one day, I'll tell my kids,<lf>"<PL> was really incredible,"<lf>and they'll all be like, "Oooooooh!"
<string>I'll do my best to keep it "historically<lf>accurate" when I tell it while having<lf>a few. Hahaha!
<string>Everything's been all hustle and bustle<lf>lately, but things seem to have quieted<lf>a bit. I thought there'd be less cargo.
<string>But it's the opposite. Now there's MORE.<lf>More. Cargo. HOW!?
<string>Everyone's been working extra hard<lf>to keep up with everything that you've<lf>been doing!
<string>Ha! I would say me too, but I'm already bustin'<lf>my butt! If I work any harder you might find<lf>me keeled over in a ditch somewhere.
<string>You're tellin' me we gotta take out two<lf>of those things to stop the Rampage?<lf>Gee whiz! Ain't one enough?
<string>Well, still, I dunno but... With you on<lf>the job, I kinda feel like everything's<lf>just gonna work out somehow.
<string>This ain't the first time people said<lf>it's impossible, and you've proved 'em<lf>wrong each time, right? You got this.
<string>Pops sent me a bottle of spirits labeled:<lf>"For bringing peace to Kamura." So,<lf>wanna pop the cork?
<string>The color is a little weird though.<lf>Can't tell if it's blue or green...<lf>It's really something.
<string>But hey, booze is booze, right!?<lf>And this calls for a celebration!<lf>I'll go get Hobashira and Ikari too!
<string>What's up, <PL>?<lf>Off to hunt?
<string>I'm just haulin' cargo like always.<lf>The days may end, but the stuff<lf>comin' into the harbor don't stop.
<string>If I don't deliver them quick,<lf>this place will be nothing but<lf>a mountain of boxes.
<string>A couple years ago, Pops said<lf>he "wanted to see the world,"<lf>and took off all of a sudden.
<string>Ever since, he's been bouncin' from<lf>place to place, and sending me all<lf>kinds of oddities with his letters.
<string>Before, he'd come back every once in<lf>a while, but the Rampage made it so<lf>he can't anymore.
<string>But he's still worried about Kamura.<lf>He's been writing a lot more letters.<lf>And sending a lot weirder stuff...
<string>In this line of work, the best kind<lf>of food is whatever I can eat on<lf>the go.
<string>That's basically nothing but Bunny<lf>Dango. Then Kajika starts pesterin'<lf>me... "Eat more fish. Eat more fish!"
<string>Look, I like fish, and I'll eat fish, but<lf>I can't be walking around with all these<lf>deliveries trying to eat a whole dang fish!
<string>It'd be great if he could clean them and<lf>sell them to me. Maybe I'll ask him.
<string>The harbor's run by Hobashira. He moors<lf>the ships and deals with payment, then<lf>me and Ikari do the hauling.
<string>Hobashira surveys the incoming goods,<lf>counting 'em up and checking for any<lf>damage.
<string>Then he does the same for any outgoing<lf>goods, and negotiates their prices.
<string>He's got a sense for what'll be in high<lf>demand, stocks up accordingly, and<lf>even parleys with all Kamura's elites.
<string>I've had to do his job a couple of times<lf>when he was busy with other things.<lf>It was tough!
<string>Just sittin' around the harbor all day<lf>isn't for me! That's why what I do suits<lf>me just fine. Gotta move. Gotta GO!
<string>Seeing Komitsu running her candy apple<lf>shop always reminds me of this one time<lf>when she was real little...
<string>Since I walk around all day, Komitsu<lf>said she wanted to know how many<lf>steps I took.
<string>She followed me from the harbor,<lf>counting out loud behind me,<lf>"OOONE, TWOOOOO..." And so on.
<string>She was doin' OK up to a hundred, but<lf>she started crying when she realized<lf>she didn't know how to count past that.
<string>Hehehe. Always puts a smile on my face<lf>thinking back on it.
<string>Seihaku's rice balls are good to eat<lf>when I'm on the go. Which is pretty<lf>much all the time.
<string>Only problem is, whenever I go to<lf>Seihaku's, Wakana shows up without<lf>fail to load me up with veggies.
<string>She's always like, "Hey now!<lf>Don't be picky, eat your greens!"
<string>She sounds so much like my mom,<lf>I can't say anything back to her...
