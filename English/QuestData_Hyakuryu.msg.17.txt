<string>Alright. It won't be long before the<lf>Rampage reaches our front door! Our<lf>defenders will do their best to hold 'em<lf>off, but if anything makes it through,<lf>you're up! Got it!? Good! Bwahahaha!<lf>Now go get to it!
<string>The Rampage draws near, johoho,<lf>but we are ready! The villagers will<lf>be stationed along the perimeter of<lf>the Stronghold, while you take position<lf>inside. These hordes must be dealt<lf>with harshly and without hesitation!<lf>Understood? Well then, hop to it-to it!
<string>The Rampage grows stronger<lf>and now we have reports of even<lf>more dangerous monsters among<lf>the horde! I trust your abilities,<lf>but be extra careful out there!<lf>We're counting on you, johoho!<lf>Now hop to it-to it!
<string>Listen up: another Rampage is on<lf>its way! Despite repellin' Narwa, its<lf>influence on other monsters still<lf>remains strong. Sorry, Squirt, them<lf>plans of relaxin' in the Hub, double-<lf>fistin' some dango are gonna have<lf>to wait! Bwaha—Now, go get to it!
<string>Listen up, Squirt: got another<lf>Rampage on the way! But hey,<lf>with Ibushi and Narwa gone, we're<lf>finally seein' some light at the end<lf>of that tunnel! Till then, it's up to our<lf>ol' Savior of Kamura to handle up<lf>any stragglers! Now, go get to it!

<string>The Guild has reported that<lf>a particularly dangerous Apex<lf>Rathian is part of this horde!<lf>Be careful. It's said that it has<lf>a special attack where it uses<lf>its poison tail spikes to spew<lf>out noxious gas.
<string>The Guild has reported that<lf>a particularly dangerous Apex<lf>Mizutsune is part of this horde!<lf>Be careful. It's said that it has<lf>a special attack that showers<lf>its surroundings in explosive<lf>bubbles!
<string>The Guild has reported that<lf>a particularly dangerous Apex<lf>Rathalos is part of this horde!<lf>Be careful. It's said that it has<lf>a special attack in which its<lf>flurry of devastating fireballs<lf>destroys everything!

<string>Ibushi is on its way here with<lf>an entire army! That monster<lf>must have some kinda organ<lf>that keeps it afloat... Find it<lf>and focus all your attacks on it!<lf>Maybe you can use the winds<lf>to your advantage or somethin'!
