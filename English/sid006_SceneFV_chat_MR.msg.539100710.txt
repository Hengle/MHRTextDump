<string>Hunting always makes<lf>me feel so alive!
<string>Well then, let's see if there<lf>is anything worth gathering.
<string>Well done! You inspire me<lf>to improve my skills!
<string>Exploring, as well as hunting,<lf>is a good source of adventure!
<string>I wonder if there are any<lf>tradable goods we can find?
<string>What lovely scenery! Nature<lf>is astounding, is it not!?
<string>Why, sister, I merely wield<lf>my weapon with all my might.
<string>Knights must learn to focus more on their<lf>target and less on their technique...
<string>Brace yourself, Hunter. These little<lf>"recaps" of hers are never-ending.
<string>Hinoa, I must say I'm impressed<lf>with both you and your sister.
<string>Even within the Royal Order, there<lf>are few with your level of skill.
<string>After posing as a trader for so long,<lf>my true identity must come as a shock.
<string>Minoto, I must say<lf>you have a natural gift.
<string>If you were to become a hunter,<lf>you'd rise to the top in no time!
<string>Hee hee, don't say that! You need<lf>to put yourself first too sometimes!
<string>Oh, stop. Hehehe.<lf>You're making me blush!
<string>Wait— What do you mean, "rumors"?<lf>When did THOSE start?
