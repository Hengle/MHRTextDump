<string>This is the Buddy Piazza!
<string><NOFAC>Hiya, <PL>!<lf>I've been waiting fur you.
<string>I've been dispatched from the Buddy<lf>Plaza in Kamura to handle Buddy<lf>affairs here in Elgado.
<string>To be purr-fectly honest, I didn't make it<lf>as a Buddy because hunting's not my<lf>thing. But this job is ideal fur me!
<string>And I'm purr-etty excited to get the<lf>chance to help out the hero of Kamura!<lf>It's a real purr-leasure—I mean, pleasure!
<string>Oh, and have you seen the Buddy Board<lf>in Elgado yet?
<string><CAM:0>This is it, just next to me here.<lf>I hope you'll make good use of it<lf>alongside the Piazza!
<string>I've received good mews—I mean,<lf>NEWS from Iori!
<string><NOFAC>Hiya, <PL>! I have<lf>a message from Iori.
<string>Meow—I mean, NOW you have access<lf>to more Buddy Skills!
<string>To use these new Buddy Skills, you have<lf>to hire Buddies that're studying them. I'm<lf>sure they can't wait to work with you!
<string>Look what's unlocked!
<string><NOFAC>Hiya, <PL>! <COLS RED>Secret<lf>Support Moves</COL> have been unlocked!
<string>These special—and secret *shhhh*—Support<lf>Moves are su-purr powerful moves that<lf>your Palicoes can use during a quest!
<string>So powerful that your Palicoes can only<lf>learn one at a time! I hope you give 'em<lf>all a try!
<string>Look what's unlocked!
<string><NOFAC>Hiya, <PL>! <COLS RED>Increase<lf>Skill Memory</COL> has been unlocked!
<string>Use this to increase the memory your<lf>Buddy's need to learn more skills.
<string>You'll need <COLS RED>Eurekacorn</COL> to boost Memory,<lf>but I got my paws on a mew—f-few,<lf>thanks to Iori.
<string>This is for you, try it meow-t!
<string>Let's talk trade!
<string><NOFAC>Hiya, <PL>! Could I<lf>interest you in some <COLS RED>backroom deals</COL>,<lf>purr-haps?
<string>Oh, don't worry, it's nothing shady!<lf>No need to reach fur your weapon!<lf>(Geez, talk about a trigger finger...)
<string>Send your Buddy off to trade with<lf>a <COLS RED>Letter of Introduction</COL>, and they'll<lf>be able to do some backroom deals.
<string>I'm told that sometimes your Buddies will<lf>bring back other various items in addition<lf>to the items they are trading for.
<string>They might even bring back some<lf>special items!
<string>But don't take my word for it! Try it<lf>meow-t—I mean, OUT for yourself,<lf>you won't regret it!
<string>My ears have also detected word of new<lf>bonuses that might be earned from<lf>markets! Sounds nice, huh?
<string>If you're interested in getting your paws on<lf>them, try sending some of your Buddies out!
<string>I've received some intel from Master<lf>Kogarashi.
<string><NOFAC>Hiya, <PL>! Master<lf>Kogarashi sent me a message!
<string>You can meow—I mean, NOW deploy<lf>the Meowcenaries to do <COLS RED>Buddy Recon</COL>.
<string>Deploying a Buddy to a Recon Point<lf>allows you to fast travel there once<lf>during a quest!
<string>Isn't that great? Now Buddies are even<lf>more useful than ever! Give it a try!
<string>I've received a message from<lf>Master Kogarashi.
<string><NOFAC>Cultural exchange with Elgado has<lf>afforded new tasks for the Meowcenaries.
<string>The Meowcenaries can now be dispatched<lf>to master rank quest regions, where more<lf>dangerous monsters reside.
<string>Such harrowing missions should be a cinch<lf>for your Buddies! Don't be afraid to send<lf>the-meow-t. *ahem* I mean "them out."
<string>I've received a message from<lf>Master Kogarashi.
<string><NOFAC>Oh, <PL>! Master Kogarashi<lf>sent me a secret message!
<string>I'm told that the Meowcenaries witnessed<lf>some <COLS RED>Qurio</COL> activity in the vicinity of a<lf>presently active master rank quest.
<string>Maybe the Qurio is why the monsters in<lf>that area seem more active than normal.
<string>And so! Master Kogarashi's calling on<lf>you, <PL>, to dispatch your<lf>Buddies to that area.
<string>"If you spot any Qurio, have your team<lf>investigate," he says.
<string>It's a dangerous mission, but you'll get<lf>heaps more materials. Gird your lions—I-<lf>I mean loins—and conquer this challenge.
<string>I need a helping paw!
<string><NOFAC>Hiya, <PL>! Check this<lf>meow-t—I mean, out! I thought up a way to<lf>let your Palicoes swap their Support Moves.
<string>Once I make it a reality, they'll be able to<lf>purr-ovide even better support! I just need<lf>a helping paw to get it started!
<string>I need someone to gather materials for<lf>making the training tools, and you're<lf>the one to do it, <PL>.
<string>Once this training gets off the ground,<lf>you better believe your Palicoes are<lf>gonna grow! All I need are supplies!
<string>Thanks a whole bunch.
<string><NOFAC>I a-purr-ciate—*ahem* apPREciate the<lf>help! Now you can change your Palico's<lf>Support Moves in the Buddy Dojo.
<string>You can only swap out some for now,<lf>but in the future, you'll be able to swap<lf>out more!
<string>When the time comes, I'll be sure to<lf>call on you again for an assist,<lf><PL>!

<string>I need a helping paw.
<string><NOFAC>I know how busy you are, but I'm looking<lf>to secure a new place fur support move<lf>purr-actice.
<string>I've found the purr-fect training spot,<lf>but it's also surrounded by monsters.<lf>All I can train there is my cowardice!
<string>I'm sure you know what's coming next.<lf>I want you to clear meow-t—I mean, clear<lf>OUT any monsters in the area for me.
<string>With the new area available, your Buddies<lf>will flourish! You'll reap the rewards,<lf>I purromise!
<string>Thank you so much.
<string><NOFAC>With the area secure, everyone can<lf>focus on training! It's purrfect!
<string>I'm sure you'll see an increase in the type<lf>of Support Moves your Buddies can learn<lf>as a result. Try making some changes!
<string>Oh! The smell of fish, swimming up from<lf>the harbor! No wonder I feel so hungry.<lf>Ah, no! I must maintain my focus!
<string>I need a helping paw!
<string><NOFAC>I know how busy you are, so I'll keep<lf>this brief. I need to have a word with<lf>your Buddies—and not about work, either.
<string>With daily training, all the Buddies are<lf>showing furnomenal growth! As the one<lf>in charge, I can't thank you enough!
<string>But I've got big plans and I'm not slowing<lf>down! Are you with me?
<string>I'm going to be purresumptuous and<lf>assume you are! So, can I ask another<lf>fur a favor?
<string>Training complete!
<string><NOFAC>You finished off that tricky training<lf>beautifully. It's clear how much you<lf>care fur your Buddies.
<string>This also means your Buddies will be<lf>able to pass on their Buddy Skills.
<string>But I'm not finished yet! I'm gonna<lf>support you with everything I've got!<lf>I hope you're ready fur more!

<string>I need a helping paw!
<string><NOFAC>I know how busy you are, but I'm hoping<lf>to impurrove our Support Move<lf>training area.
<string>And to do that, we need to upgrade our gear.<lf>I've heard that weapons made from Rajang<lf>Wildpelt bring courage and power.
<string>If it's true what I've heard, a material<lf>upgrade to our training tools should give<lf>the Buddies a real boost!
<string>Furgive me for always calling on your<lf>skills, but could you secure me<lf>a Rajang Wildpelt?
<string>Thank you so much!
<string><NOFAC>You got the material I need!<lf>Now the buddies will be able to do some<lf>high-level training and really blossom!
<string>I'm sure you'll see an increase in the type<lf>of Support Moves your Buddies can learn<lf>as a result. Try making some changes!
<string>It's really going to come in paw-y on the<lf>hunt. And remember, if you're looking<lf>for new Buddies, I'm your...buddy!
<string>I'll relay whatever Buddy instructions<lf>or requests you give me straight<lf>to Kamura.
<string>And without a moment's paws, you'll be<lf>able to manage Meowcenaries and scout<lf>Buddies and stuff, just like normal.
<string>I know, I know. How can one Felyne<lf>do all that single-pawedly? I amaze<lf>myself sometimes.
<string>I hear passage between here and Kamura<lf>is much safer meow—I mean, now!
<string>That'll make it way easier fur customers<lf>to reach Elgado from the village.<lf>All thanks to you, <PL>!
<string>Fur me, working so far from home, it's<lf>really exciting to think I'll get to see all<lf>my old fur-iends.
<string>So you've already heard the news fur-om<lf>the Elder Fugen, <PL>?
<string>If I could, I'd join you in opposing this<lf>threat to Kamura.
<string>But I'm sure I'd only slow you down.<lf>I guess keeping things running here<lf>is the best way fur me to help.
<string>Sounds like the Kingdom's really<lf>counting on you, <PL>.
<string>As a fellow villager, I couldn't be<lf>purr-ouder!
<string>And seeing as my work here's supporting<lf>an elite hunter like you, I say that makes<lf>me one of the elite, too.
<string>So...even after you rescued Bahari, he<lf>STILL didn't come back with you?
<string>Some say he's eccentric and some say<lf>he's crazy, but if you ask me, he must<lf>be purr-etty brave!
<string>Come to think of it, he's meow-t there all<lf>by himself with no weapons or anything!<lf>Yeah, he might be crazy after all!
<string>So you're going up against one of the<lf>Three Lords, huh? Have you purr-operly<lf>purr-epped your Buddies?
<string>Times like this you need to keep calm<lf>and check the Buddy Board beside me<lf>here nice and care-fur-lly.
<string>Sounds like Bahari helped set up a<lf>bunch of the facilities here in Elgado.
<string>Do you think that magnifurcent Buddy<lf>Board is one of his creations?
<string>It's really startin' to bug me. If you<lf>get the chance, <PL>,<lf>could you ask him fur me?
<string>Are you finding it hard to tell Hayate<lf>and Raiden apart?
<string>That's a-mew-sing. It's easy! You can tell by<lf>their expressions! They match their names<lf>purr-fectly.
<string>Don't worry, <PL>.<lf>A hunter like you will soon work it out.
<string>Who knew there were mysterious creatures<lf>like the Qurio out there? I'm more scared<lf>than surprised, though.
<string>Just imagining what it'd be like to be<lf>attacked by one of those things<lf>makes my fur stand on end.
<string>It's great that new intel's unfurling.<lf>Sounds like the research is moving<lf>forward!
<string>Remember, the Buddy Piazza's always<lf>here to help, paw-ticularly when you're<lf>so busy.
<string>Nothing gives me greater purr-leasure<lf>than backing up your ops. I'm always at<lf>your service, <PL>!
<string><VO:SER>Just like everyone else, I'm<lf>purr-etty worried about Lady Fiorayne.
<string>She always comes by and chats with me<lf>about the Piazza.
<string>Here's hoping it's not long befur she's<lf>back on her feet.
<string>So we just need to wait for the medicine<lf>and Lady Fiorayne will be OK?
<string>Oh, good. That's a relief!
<string>Hayate and Raiden are relieved, too!
<string>Hearing that Lady Fiorayne's OK again<lf>really is mewsic to my ears!
<string>If everyone in Elgado pulls together,<lf>there's nothing we can't achieve.
<string>Keep up the great work! Meow let's take<lf>it to Meowzeno—I mean, Malzeno!
<string>I'm glad to hear that even though<lf>Malzeno's history now, the research<lf>work's gonna carry on here.
<string>That means I'll be able to keep working<lf>as the Plaza rep here and keep helping<lf>you meow-t, <PL>!
<string>Whatever you need, I'll sort it out fur you!<lf>You name it, you got it!
<string>A little downturn in the weather's not<lf>gonna keep me from my duties, don't<lf>you worry.
<string>...Hayate and Raiden do keep throwing<lf>furtive glances at the sky, though.
<string>I'm starting to wonder if it's gonna get<lf>stormier than I was expecting...
<string>I never fur a moment thought we'd see<lf>the Qurio from here. Makes my fur<lf>stand on end!
<string>Be careful, <PL>.
<string>Don't worry about me! I've got Hayate<lf>and Raiden to keep me safe!
<string>Your fur-nomenal achievements bring even<lf>more honor to Kamura.
<string>I'm purr-oud to be able to say I was<lf>a small part of your success!
<string>And as the research work continues,<lf>you know you can count on me fur all<lf>your Buddy needs!
<string>Have you noticed? This great Buddy Board<lf>next to me here?
<string>It's just over-fur-lowin' with regal<lf>style and valiance, isn't it?
<string>And you know there's another board near<lf>Azuki's Tea Shop! Purr-etty convenient,<lf>right?
<string>Hunting's really not my thing, but this<lf>is the role I was born for.
<string>And I intend to give it my all! Fur everyone<lf>back at the village, and fur you, too,<lf><PL>!
<string>My bodyguards, Hayate and Raiden,<lf>are never far from my side.
<string>But even if they weren't, with the Royal<lf>Order here I'm purr-fectly safe.
<string>Which means these two have plenty of<lf>time for catnaps. Too much time, really...
<string>At first, I was a little overwhelmed by running<lf>the show solo here and on top of that I was<lf>Felyne a little homesick...
<string>But ya know what picked me up? A little<lf>taste of back home, Bunny Dango!<lf>How about you, <PL>?
<string>Sometimes it's good to furget quests<lf>and just take a little time to enjoy a<lf>well-earned treat!
<string>I pride myself on my purr-ofessionalism<lf>and self-control when I'm working.
<string>But...there are just so many temptations<lf>in this place!
<string>All those tasty treats on sale right before<lf>my eyes! It's a catastrophe fur my<lf>concentration!
<string>Fur someone like me who's not into<lf>hunting, being able to help others like<lf>this is pawsome!
<string>I really a-purr-eciate everyone from back<lf>home who gave me the op-purr-tunity<lf>to come to Elgado.
<string>I hope I can repay the favor someday.<lf>I just don't really know how...
<string>If you ever have any good ideas,<lf>I'm all ears!
<string>Let's talk trade!
<string><NOFAC>Psst, hey, <PL>! A rumor<lf>about backroom deals reached my<lf>furry Felyne ears.
<string>Between you and me, these deals are<lf>set up to put some rare articles up fur<lf>trade.
<string>With deals like these at your disposal,<lf>just imagine what awesome gear you<lf>could end up making!
<string>Deploy your Buddies to do some backroom<lf>deals and see what wares they have to<lf>offur. What do you have to lose?
<string>I've received some intel from<lf>Master Kogarashi.
<string><NOFAC>Master Kogarashi has successfully modified<lf>the Meowcenaries' kites. Now, they'll be<lf>able to survey farther-off territories.
<string>"New destinations mean new materials,<lf>so I would appreciate your cooperation,"<lf>Master says.
<string>Come to me whenever you're looking to<lf>send them meow-t—I mean, send them<lf>OUT!

<string>Purr-eparations are in place to deploy<lf>Buddies to a Buddy Recon Point in<lf>the Citadel!
<string>So go on, your Buddies are waiting to be<lf>sent meow-t—I mean, OUT!
<string>I have a message fur—FOR you!
<string><NOFAC>Hiya, <PL>! I've<lf>received some intel that they wish to<lf>speak with you back at the Buddy Plaza.
<string>Please return to Kamura Village at your<lf>leisure and see them. I'm sure they'll<lf>have good mews—I-I mean news for you!
<string>You have my gratitude!
<string><NOFAC>Hiya, <PL>!<lf>I appurr-eciate you always bringing your<lf>Buddies meow-t on quests with you!
<string>On behalf of all the Buddies here, I'd<lf>like to give you a token of thanks. Keep<lf>up the companionable conduct!
