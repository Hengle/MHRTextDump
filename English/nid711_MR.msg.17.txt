<string>So you're this hero hunter everyone's been<lf>talking about, huh? Sorry to burst your<lf>bubble, pal, but I've been here longer.
<string>I'm gonna solve the riddle of these craters<lf>so you and your lame hairstyle can get right<lf>back on that boat. Psh. You're all hype!
<string>Hey, "Hero of Kamura..." Got a little<lf>somethin' I want to ask ya.
<string>When you encounter a monster, you simply<lf>can't seem to beat, what do you do?<lf>...Asking for a friend.
<string>Nope, nope, I take that back! I mean,<lf>my friend does! No need to answer!
<string>They can work it out for themselves.<lf>They're a pretty good hunter, too,<lf>you know! My friend!
<string>Going out with Master Arlow to do some<lf>training, huh? Hmmmm.
<string>Gotta say, I'm a little jealous— You know<lf>what? Train all you want! You're gonna<lf>need it if you think you can beat me!
<string>So I went out hunting while you were gone.<lf>And...WOW! The thrill! The excitement!<lf>Nothing beats the real thing!
<string>You think you're all that! Ha! I'll catch up<lf>with you in no time! And then it's gonna<lf>be you who'll have to catch up to ME!
<string>Malzeno. Can't tell much from just<lf>the name, but it sure sounds scary.
<string>Think I can handle it? Hah, sure I can!<lf>Everyone has to start somewhere! Right?
<string>The way you hunt—I'm guessing those<lf>are Kamura techniques? They're pretty<lf>impressive—I mean, they're alright.
<string>But you know I might give 'em a go and<lf>see what works and what doesn't! But<lf>don't be stealing my moves, OK?
<string>Hold on! You're going with THE Dame<lf>Fiorayne on your next quest? Now I<lf>am jealous—for all sorts of reasons!
<string>Hey, do you think I'm meant to tag along<lf>too? That could be a thing, right? Right?
<string>Hey, I heard you've hunted some new type<lf>of Bishaten. I'm so jealous! That stupid<lf>monkey won't even throw dung my way.
<string>I should have just tagged along, even if<lf>I wasn't invited!
<string>But you still won't beat me! You got that?<lf>The Three Lords will be done and dusted,<lf>by me, before you even meet one of them!
<string>So they chose you to go out and rescue<lf>that guy, huh? I coulda done it, easily...
<string>Just shows what the Guild thinks of me.<lf>What can I do to change their minds?<lf>How can I make them see my potential?
<string>Gotta admit, that was nice work. Even<lf>urgent quests are nothing to you...
<string>How did you get so good? Were you born<lf>this way? If I can learn it by observing<lf>you, I'm gonna be watching real close!
<string>Can I? Watch you, I mean? Up close and<lf>personal? Please don't shoot me down!
<string>I'm not bothered by this at all! You're<lf>going off to do big things with Fiorayne<lf>again? So what! No bother!
<string>I'm certainly not so jealous I can<lf>hardly stand still! This writhing motion<lf>is me warming up! Think nothing of it!
<string>You did it. You really did. One of the<lf>Three Lords! All I can do is give up<lf>and respect you.
<string>You've blown me out of the water! I feel<lf>so embarrassed. I mean, I'm just starting<lf>out, but still...
<string>For the moment, I'm happy to have that<lf>self-awareness. I need to get my mind<lf>back on track. I'll beat you yet!
<string>So when you started out, did everyone<lf>underestimate you? Treat you like a know-<lf>nothing rookie?
<string>Man, I've had enough of it! I've been trying<lf>to stand up straighter, to project a better<lf>image, you know? But it's not my thing...
<string>I mean, everyone has to start somewhere!<lf>I'm done caring about what others think!<lf>I'm just gonna focus on getting better!
<string>Lunagaron, huh? Sorry I've never even<lf>seen one before. I haven't the slightest<lf>about it.
<string>The only thing I can say for sure is<lf>that it sounds cool. ...S-Sorry, that's<lf>all I've got...
<string>I used to be excited about going after<lf>super-dangerous monsters like Lunagaron,<lf>but now I don't know...
<string>With how Malzeno just burst on the scene<lf>like it did, it made me realize that you never<lf>know what's gonna happen out there.
<string>Yeah... I'm thinking no more solo quests<lf>for a while.
<string><VO:SER>You think Dame Fiorayne is OK? I mean,<lf>I know she isn't. I'm just feeling kinda<lf>low and pathetic right now.
<string><VO:NOR>I'm going to play my part in keeping the<lf>Elgado perimeter safe until the cure is<lf>found.
<string>We can't let Malzeno or any other<lf>monsters attack the place while<lf>Fiorayne is recovering!
<string>I heard there's some medicine that can<lf>help Dame Fiorayne out! Finally! Some<lf>good news!
<string>With everything happening it's good to<lf>hear something positive once in a while,<lf>you know?
<string>I-I just saw Dame Fiorayne up and walking<lf>around like nothing happened. She was in<lf>full uniform and everything!
<string>But has she really recovered enough<lf>to be able to fight Malzeno again?
<string>If I'm honest with you—and myself—<lf>I'm actually more worried about that<lf>than about Malzeno showing up.
<string>Just who are you? WHAT are you? How<lf>do you keep doing the things you do!?<lf>I can't comprehend the things you do!
<string>Congrats, anyway! Well done! You've<lf>inspired me to push myself to new heights!
<string>Those two Chevaliers... You know, the ones<lf>always talking to the Admiral. I think he<lf>sends them out on some secret ops.
<string>I'm not sure if it's to investigate the Qurio,<lf>or the boogeyman, but whatever it is,<lf>it's super hush-hush!
<string>Hey! That gives me an idea! Maybe if I start<lf>my own investigation, I can find some clues<lf>that you all might have overlooked!
<string>Hey, I heard you're going out there again.<lf>So things aren't finished yet, huh? I had<lf>a feeling that was the case...
<string>I haven't the slightest idea what's going on,<lf>to be honest, but I do know one thing—<lf>you're the one to clear all this up.
<string>So I heard some rumors that we're <lf>dealing with elder dragons now? <lf>Is that true?
<string>I thought getting to investigate those<lf>Kingdom monsters was crazy enough.<lf>But now elder dragons, too?
<string>What an incredible experience! It feels<lf>like my life as hunter only really started<lf>after meeting you!
<string>I bet there's nothing you can't hunt.<lf>As far as I know, you're the ultimate<lf>hunter!
<string>Although I kinda recall my mother<lf>saying something about fighting elder<lf>dragons back in the day?
<string>Well, who knows about that stuff? The<lf>point is, you're the best hunter I've ever<lf>seen! And I get to say that *I* know you!
<string>Not sure about you, but I come from<lf>a long line of hunters. Hunting's in<lf>my blood.
<string>And I'm not going home until I've hunted<lf>the biggest and baddest! So stay out of<lf>my way, OK? Malzeno is mine!
<string>Who do you think has taken down the<lf>biggest monsters in my family? I'll give<lf>ya a hint, it's not my pops, or my brother.
<string>Not my gramps either... It's my mother!<lf>The ol' gal is a force to reckon with!<lf>She's not to be messed with! Ha!
<string>This is my first time ever seeing a Chevalier.<lf>I've heard they often go out on these super<lf>special and secret missions.
<string>They must have been posted to Elgado<lf>to help research those Kingdom monsters.
<string>I'd love to pick their brains a little,<lf>but I doubt they'd even glance at<lf>a rookie hunter like me.
<string>Being born into a family of hunters<lf>can be hard. The only way to win their<lf>approval is by proving you can hunt.
<string>And being treated like a rookie around<lf>here sure doesn't help. But no one ever<lf>said it was easy hunting monsters!
<string>It's strange, though. Even with all that<lf>family history, I don't feel like being<lf>a hunter is a burden.
<string>And now I want to be a better hunter,<lf>not for them, but for myself. I guess<lf>that's what it's all about, huh?
<string>Man, I hate how all the other hunters<lf>call me a rookie and treat me like a kid...<lf>It sucks!
<string>But seeing you in action is a real<lf>inspiration! The things you've overcome!<lf>It's incredible!
<string>And it's motivated me to get better! I'm<lf>gonna grab up all the quests I can, and one<lf>day, ONE DAY, I'll beat you! Just you wait!
<string>I've also started daydreaming about<lf>making Kamura my base of operations.<lf>Sound good to you?
<string>Just like when I left home to come here,<lf>it feels like I need to do something big<lf>to break out of my shell.
<string>When you've got some time, I'd love to<lf>hear more about the place. The terrain<lf>over there, and the monsters.
<string>And the people of Kamura. The people<lf>in the place you grew up. I'm looking<lf>forward to it already!
