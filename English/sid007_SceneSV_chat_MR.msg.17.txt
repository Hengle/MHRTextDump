<string>The hunting grounds, eh?<lf>Really brings me back...
<string>What makes it even better is<lf>that I'm with you, Squirt!
<string>Magnamalo's connection with<lf>Kamura Village runs deep.
<string>We know what kind of threat it<lf>poses, what it's capable of.
<string><PL>, we won't<lf>stop 'til we finish this hunt.
<string>Don't mention it. This<lf>concerns our village, as well.
<string>Besides, <PL><lf>is getting lots of experience!
<string>You make us proud!<lf>Let's see how far you've come.
<string>Alright! Time to show this new<lf>generation how us ol' timers do it!
<string>Alright Squirt! Watch and learn!<lf>We still got some fire left in us!
<string>None of the folks visitin' from Kamura<lf>are givin' ya any trouble, are they?
<string>And we'll give ya a proper Kamura<lf>welcome, too! Bwahaha!
<string>Alright, ol' Galleus! No holding<lf>back! Let's see whatcha got!
<string>Bwahaha!<lf>Now I'm really fired up!
<string>Ha! We cleaned out every single<lf>shop in the village!
<string>Bwahaha!<lf>Maybe we did eat too much...
<string>So, uh, Komitsu wanted to come<lf>out with us...
<string>Well, Utsushi said she's gettin'<lf>pretty good with a Hammer!
<string>Bwahaha! Wait— Does that mean<lf>Minoto can call upon Narwa?
<string>I think we've had enough of you two<lf>resonatin' with them serpents!
<string>Alright! Time to heat things up!
<string>I guess the village is safe if you<lf>can come out to play.
<string>Ha! Don't worry! Ol' Hoj's<lf>lookin' after everything!
<string>Let's have some fun today!
<string>Alright, Squirt! Try to keep up!
