<string>Sup, Ace? I figured you be gettin' busy,<lf>so I decided to come see how Elgado's<lf>treatin' ya!
<string>Things have pretty much calmed down<lf>over in Kamura, so I'll come check in<lf>on ya when I'm free!
<string>What are me and my favorite pupil<lf>gonna get up to in Elgado, huh?<lf>Can't wait to find out!
<string>Sup, Ace! Looks like you got a request<lf>from back home to hunt a Blood Orange<lf>Bishaten!
<string>And it's actin' like a hoser in the Shrine<lf>Ruins, huh? Wonder if those Kingdom<lf>monsters have anything to do with it...
<string>Sounds like a royal pain, but nothing<lf>my favorite pupil can't handle! Alright,<lf>Ace! Go out and make us proud!
<string>Looks like the influence of these Kingdom<lf>monsters is really startin' to take hold.
<string>I've been doin' a little recon out in the field.<lf>Haven't found anything too gnarly yet, but<lf>it's definitely spreadin'!
<string>We've gotta nip this in the bud early!<lf>But with everyone in Elgado and my<lf>Ace on the case, it's in the bag!
<string>I hear the research team has been after<lf>the Three Lords, but not having much luck.<lf>I mean, I could track 'em down...
<string>But I'm not trying to step on any toes<lf>here. Plus I have my own missions<lf>from Elder Fuges to tend to.
<string>I'm sure they'll have their answers<lf>in no time! Just gotta be patient.<lf>Hang tight, Ace!
<string>Whoa! One of the Three Lords, huh?<lf>So the hunt begins! And it's my<lf>favorite pupil taking the lead!
<string>Nothing get's your blood pumpin' like<lf>facin' a new monster, am I right? Not<lf>knowing what you're up against...
<string>But just roll with it. You know, go with the<lf>flow! Stay focused and remember what<lf>I taught ya and you'll never lose!
<string>Welcome back, Ace ! I've been waitin'<lf>for ya. And Bahari's here, too.
<string>So this guy's the man with the plan, huh?<lf>I don't know too many scientist—wait!<lf>I don't know ANY scientists!
<string>What's he like? Is he cool with ninjas<lf>and other gnarly stuff? Oh, man!<lf>I can't wait to meet him!
<string>Whoa! Those are some gnarly little creatures!
<string>Pretty cool that Bahari picked up on 'em<lf>just by examinin' that Garangolm! What an<lf>ace! But you're still my number one!
<string>And That's a good lesson for you, too! Make<lf>sure you're lookin' out for little details, too!<lf>Like, did you notice I trimmed my hair?
<string>Alright, Ace! Time to thrash that Lunagaron!
<string>It might have gotten the drop on us back<lf>in the Shrine Ruins! But the tabis have<lf>turned! Or is it tables?
<string>Either way, go show it what you're made of!
<string><VO:SER>ACE, ARE YOU OK!?<lf>I heard you got attacked by Malzeno!
<string>Oh, not even a scratch? Phew! What<lf>a relief! I don't know what I'd do<lf>without my Ace... *ahem*
<string>There's still a lot we don't know about<lf>Malzeno and the Qurio so stay on your<lf>guard and be careful out there, OK?
<string><VO:SER>I just heard the news about Lady Fiorayne!
<string>Poisoned by the Qurio, huh? Who coulda<lf>saw that coming...? Not cool Qurio...<lf>Not cool...
<string><VO:NOR>Anyway, her recovery should be top<lf>priority now. If you need anything<lf>at all, just let me know.
<string>Sup, Ace? ...You OK? You seem a little<lf>down about what happened to Fiorayne.
<string>You can't fool your master, Ace. If you're<lf>bummed about something, don't be afraid<lf>to let it show. Don't keep stuff bottled up.
<string>Hey, bet I can cheer you up. Check this<lf>out, "Go ninja, go—" No? Oh, c'mon!
<string>Alright, Ace! Time to give Malzeno<lf>the thrashin' of a lifetime!
<string>Now that Fiorayne's back on her feet,<lf>you two are unstoppable!
<string>Remember I've always got your back!<lf>You got nothing to worry about, OK?<lf>Go out there and make me proud!
<string>Whoa! Way to thrash, Ace! I bet Malzeno<lf>didn't even know what hit 'em!
<string>Like Admiral Galleus told you, there's<lf>somethin' goin' on but we can't talk about<lf>it just yet. We're still checkin' it out...
<string>But I can say this:<lf>It's not over yet. Stay sharp, Ace!
<string>Sup, Ace. Something wrong?<lf>You look troubled.
<string>So you're worried about the Qurio actin'<lf>weird—er, weirder?
<string>Well, until Bahari has more intel for us,<lf>all we can do is keep our guard up and<lf>our eyes peeled.
<string>This is what we've been waitin' for, Ace!<lf>It's finally time to face the Archdemon<lf>of the Abyss!
<string>Sorry I had to keep you in the dark...<lf>It was hard not bein' able to tell, but<lf>believe me, I meant well.
<string>We had to be sure, you know? If we were<lf>wrong we might have caused a mass panic<lf>for nothing! You understand, right? Cool!
<string>Anyway, this is it! You got this! This legendary<lf>hoser's got nothing on my legendary Ace!<lf>Go show 'em what a Kamura hunter can do!
<string>Welcome back, Ace! I knew you could do it!
<string>Well, things are gonna start settlin'<lf>down here in Elgado now.
<string>That means you should have some time<lf>on your hands now, right? For what!?<lf>To go hunting with your master!
<string>Do you know how long I've been waitin' to<lf>go out on the hunt with my favorite pupil!?<lf>Since Elgado doesn't need you so much—
<string>...What!? You still got a quest to handle?<lf>Oh, c'mon, Ace! Let's go hunting together!<lf>Pleeeeeeeeasse! *sniff*
<string>Sup, Ace? How are things with Arlow?
<string>He's pretty cool, huh? But not as cool as<lf>your master back in Kamura!
<string>Makes you think, "Wow, that guy is<lf>the best! I'm so lucky!" Right? RIGHT!?
<string>Sup, Ace! You ever chill with Pasapato?<lf>He's got so much gnarly knowledge about<lf>stuff! I could listen to him for hours!
<string>Everything he says is fascinating! When<lf>I sit down to talk to him—BOOM!—five<lf>hours fly by like nothing!
<string>Don't tell Elder Fugen, but Pasapato has<lf>the funniest stories about him when he was<lf>younger. I was crackin' up the whole time!
<string>Sup, Ace! You enjoyin' the Bunny Dango<lf>here in Elgado?
<string>Man, the other day me and Pasapato ate<lf>so many dango, we could have given<lf>Hinoa a run for her zenny...
<string>Well, maybe not THAT many, but still.<lf>They were so good! Azuki sure knows<lf>how to make 'em!
<string>Sup, Ace! I was checking out that crater<lf>earlier...
<string>I don't know what it is, but the more you<lf>look at it, the bigger it gets. Almost like<lf>it's drawin' you in or something!
<string>I wonder if it's hidin' a dark secret... Or<lf>maybe it's just a big hole! Either way,<lf>I'll probably talk to Pasapato about it!
<string>Sup, Ace! So you know how I make<lf>masks, right? Wha—!?
<string>...You've seen them!?<lf>They're on display at Azuki's Tea Shop!?<lf>But they were a flop in Kamura...
<string>Whoa! Sounds like I might have a market in<lf>the Kingdom. That's actually pretty exciting!<lf>Maybe I'll become an ace craftsman!
<string>Sup, Ace! I've gotta say, you keep<lf>surpassin' my expectations, time<lf>after time!
<string>It's tough bein' master to such<lf>a highflier, you know? I have to<lf>work myself pretty hard!
<string>What if, like, I become such a great<lf>teacher that I get flooded with new<lf>students and stuff?
<string>Don't worry, though! No matter how<lf>many students I have you'll always<lf>be my favorite pupil!
