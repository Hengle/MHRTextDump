<string>Oh, hi, <PL>.<lf>Getting ready to go to the Kingdom's outpost?
<string>That must be exciting and frightening<lf>at the same time. Hunting in unknown<lf>lands with unknown people.
<string>But don't you worry about a thing.<lf>The key to making friends is a<lf>good meal and good times.
<string>And the key to a good meal is rice.<lf>Make sure you take plenty with you!
<string>Welcome back, <PL>!
<string>I just overheard Wakana and Hinami<lf>saying you were back.
<string>Looks like you're doing well. Of course,<lf>we're always glad to see you back home.
<string>Take care of yourself, and good luck out<lf>there. Make sure you fill up on as much<lf>home cooking as you can before you go.
<string>Welcome back, <PL>.<lf>So, how's life in Elgado?<lf>Hopefully treating you well.
<string>How's the Tea Shop doing over there?<lf>I heard the Felynes who run it all used<lf>to work under Otemai.
<string>I wonder how they're doing... That's<lf>such a big responsibility for such<lf>little kitties to be in charge of.
<string>I guess I shouldn't worry much. Otemai<lf>runs a tight ship, so I'm sure they're<lf>working their little tails off.
<string>Oh, hi, <PL>.<lf>Welcome back. How are you doing?
<string>You know, if you ever need anything,<lf>you shouldn't hesitate to ask others<lf>for help.
<string>My beloved husband, as strong as he is,<lf>always reaches out if he has a problem<lf>he can't solve on his own.
<string>I suppose that is especially true for<lf>hunters. Hunting solo is admirable,<lf>but if a quest becomes too much...
<string>There's no shame in asking for help<lf>from your teammates to help you<lf>pull through.
<string>The other day my husband came<lf>home with my picture framed<lf>with a lovely poem.
<string>The words were so wonderfully written<lf>by Master Hojo, I asked my husband to<lf>read it to me.
<string>It was a very beautiful poem, full of love.<lf>It made me a little embarrassed, actually...
<string>He had also asked Shiika to write<lf>a poem for me. I was very moved...<lf>by the gesture.
<string>I'm happy with all the words my<lf>husband tells me every day, even<lf>if it's not such a great poem.
<string>The rice today was wonderful...<lf>Wonderful like my husband.
<string>Do you know what this is, <PL>?<lf>This is true happiness.
