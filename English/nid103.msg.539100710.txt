<string>Yo, over here!
<string><NOFAC><CAM:18>Lookin' good, Ace! Gratz on becoming<lf>a hunter! All that hard work finally paid<lf>off... I'm really happy for ya!
<string>Oh, and before I forget...<lf>I gotta tell you about the <COLS RED>Action Bar</COL>!
<string>The Action Bar <COLS RED>lets you pull off all<lf>sorts of actions without opening any<lf>menus</COL>. Pretty gnarly if you ask me!
<string>Let's try it out! <COLS RED>Select the Camera from<lf>the Action Bar and snap a picture of me!</COL>
<string>Once you take my picture,<lf>let me see it!
<string>Hey! You got it!
<string><NOFAC><CAM:18>Oh yeah! That's one handsome Deviljho!<lf>Heh! Now that you've gotten acquainted<lf>with the Action Bar, I think it's quest time!
<string>But if you're still not confident in<lf>your abilities, you can hit up the<lf><COLS RED>Training Area</COL> to sharpen 'em up!
<string>It's just a short boat ride from<lf>the <COLS RED>Buddy Plaza</COL> where Iori and<lf>all his furry friends hang out.
<string>You can try your hand at all sorts of<lf>weapons and skills there. It's a great<lf>place to warm up before a big hunt.
<string>...Alright, I'll quit holding you up.<lf>Hinoa's still waiting for you, isn't she?
<string><NOFAC>Come on, Ace!<lf><COLS RED>Select Camera from the Action Bar and<lf>snap a picture of me!</COL>
<string>Once you take my picture,<lf>let me see it!
<string>Yo, Ace!
<string><NOFAC>Yo, <PL>!<lf>My favorite pupil!
<string>Look at you!<lf>An official Hunter of Kamura!<lf>You ready to thrash!?
<string>Y'know, training hunters isn't the only<lf>thing I do around here—I also give out<lf><COLS RED>arena quests</COL>.
<string>There are two types of quest you can<lf>take on here: <COLS RED>Arena Quests</COL> and<lf><COL RED>Challenge Quests</COL>.
<string>They're both special types of quests,<lf>perfect for honing your hunting skills!
<string>They become available as you<lf>successfully complete hunts<lf>and gain new abilities.
<string>So, how many d'ya think<lf>you can start off with? Ten?
<string>Hah! Just kidding ya. Swing by every now<lf>and then and take a look. Besides, I'm<lf>always curious to see how you're doing!
<string>Yo, Ace!<lf>How are the Hub quests going?
<string>I've been checking all the<lf>happenings around the village<lf>and...something's off.
<string>You can be sure as shurikens<lf>that whatever it is, we'll be facing<lf>off against it soon.
<string>Yo, Ace.<lf>Rampage time.
<string>And time for you to lace your tabi up!<lf>Defending within the Stronghold falls<lf>on your well-armored shoulders!
<string>Don't let your instructor or Kamura<lf>down! If we all do our parts, we can<lf>get through this!
<string>Yo, Ace!<lf>What can I say? You rocked out there.<lf>Just like I taught ya!
<string>You know what? Even if this whole<lf>Rampage thing never lets up. With<lf>your skill and my training...
<string>...I think we'd be OK.<lf>I know it's a tough gig, but my training<lf>will keep you prepared. Believe that!
<string>Yo, Ace! Good job on thrashing that Tetranadon.<lf>Way to impress your instructor!
<string>It's only gonna get harder from here<lf>on out, so don't you start slacking<lf>on your training, OK!?
<string>But don't overdo it, now. It is<lf>possible to train too much.<lf>I know, I know. Hard to believe.
<string>Sometimes you just gotta get<lf>your head clear. Go for a walk<lf>out in the forest or something.
<string>Can't have your head full of<lf>unimportant stuff when I still<lf>have so much to teach you!
<string>You have been absolutely killing it out there.<lf>And I'm not the only one who's noticed.<lf>Master Hojo has been scoping you out!
<string>Said he was crazy impressed with your<lf>work. And if he's impressed with you,<lf>that means he's impressed with ME!
<string>I'm glad my training has been paying off.<lf>Too bad I can't see first-hand how effective<lf>it is with Elder Fuges keeping me busy...
<string>If we ever get through this Rampage<lf>mess, how about we go out and do<lf>a little hunting together, OK?
<string>Yoooo, Ace! Hope you're ready to<lf>thrash, 'cause this time you've got<lf>some Apex action coming your way!
<string>These badboys are nothing to mess around<lf>with. Even the sorriest bunch of monsters<lf>can be a real handful when one is around.
<string>But just like with all things, you'll be just<lf>fine out there if you remember everything<lf>I taught ya!
<string><VO:SER>That blue serpent...<lf>Talk about a buzzkill.
<string>I know you must be worried about<lf>Hinoa, but don't let anger cloud<lf>your mind...or something.
<string>Seeing one of our own like that<lf>sure bums me out but I gotta<lf>set an example.
<string>And as my star pupil, you have to set<lf>an example too. We can't be losing<lf>our heads now OR our focus!
<string>Hey! I hear you're a<lf>high-rank hunter now!<lf>Way to go, Ace!
<string>Elder Fuges was truly wise to see your<lf>potential. And to think, I got to see your<lf>talent blossom!
<string>W-Well, heh, don't mind me<lf>getting all sentimental here!<lf>You keep aiming for the top!
<string>But don't strain yourself.<lf>Make sure to rest well, and<lf>take it easy sometimes, too!
<string>Yo, Ace! We're still scoping out the<lf>situation with that blue serpent.<lf>Just need a little more time.
<string>I've seen it a lot since, though. Last<lf>was with the Guild peeps when you<lf>were hunting that Jyuratodus.
<string>And to me, it looks like it's<lf>descending lower and lower<lf>with each sighting...
<string>I guess it'll be upon us soon enough.<lf>Brace yourself.
<string>So this hoser, Wind Serpent Ibushi, is<lf>the one causing the Rampage? And<lf>now it's set its sights on the Stronghold.
<string>I guess it's thinking we're not gonna<lf>be able to put up much of a fight.<lf>That's why it's started its descent.
<string>But maybe we can use that to our<lf>advantage. If it underestimates us,<lf>we can put it in a world of hurt!
<string>We might even be able to repel it if<lf>we drag the fight out long enough.<lf>This can work. It has to!
<string>Alright, Ace.<lf>I hope you're ready to thrash.
<string>Yo, Ace!<lf>It's finally time to put<lf>the smackdown on Ibushi!
<string>I've given you every last ounce<lf>of hunting expertise I got!<lf>There's no way you can lose!
<string>I can't wait till you come home with<lf>that big victory smile on your face!
<string>Way to go, Ace! Ibushi's gonna<lf>feel that one in the morning!
<string>That blowhard got SMOKED and flew<lf>home crying. Wherever "home" is,<lf>I'm sure we'll know soon enough.
<string>Only concern is this "queen"<lf>it showed up looking for.<lf>Still gotta figure that one out.
<string>The end of the Rampage'll<lf>have to wait until we do, but<lf>we'll keep looking into it!
<string>So that hoser's queen,<lf>Thunder Serpent Narwa...
<string>We've been out looking for it.<lf>Hopefully, with Minoto's help,<lf>we can find it.
<string><VO:SER>We've got a vague idea where it's at,<lf>but it looks like it's lurking way out<lf>in the boonies, and we're exhausted...
<string>Yo, Ace. Not to get all mushy,<lf>but what I said before? I meant<lf>it with all my heart.
<string>Seeing you thrash these monsters...<lf>It's giving me hope that we can really,<lf>I mean, REALLY do this!
<string>You're Kamura's hope, Ace.<lf>You be careful out there!<lf>Instructor's orders!
<string>I'm sure you've heard by now that<lf>I went looking for Narwa, but looks<lf>like it bailed. I know, right?
<string>Both of those hosers are still kickin'<lf>and now, they're trying to team up.<lf>Totally not cool.
<string>The twins are doing their thing but<lf>can't seem to find them...
<string>Maybe it's because the serpents<lf>are wounded or they're too far away.
<string>I'll let you know if we find out anything.
<string>Looks like we got a big problem, Ace.<lf>What kind of problem? The super-strong-<lf>monsters-popping-up-all-over-the-place kind!
<string>If any are a threat, you can be sure<lf>as shurikens Minoto'll have a quest<lf>ready to go.
<string>I recommend you stay suited up<lf>and ready to go at all times!
<string>Yo, Ace! We finally found out where<lf>those two hosers are hiding at.
<string>You can be sure as shurikens that they're<lf>gonna be a REAL pain to take down, but<lf>if anyone can do it, it's you. I know it!
<string>So go get 'em, Ace!<lf>Take 'em down and come back a hero!
<string>I didn't think I could be any prouder<lf>of ya, Ace, but then you went and<lf>saved the whole freakin' village!
<string>And don't you forget—it was your persistent<lf>courage and effort that got you this far.<lf>You were totally gnarly out there!
<string>But don't go thinking you're done just yet!<lf>There's still a whole world of monsters to<lf>trash on, so keep your tabi laced up!
<string>Yo, Ace! Looks like you've been making some<lf>serious moves.
<string>You know, I can't tell ya how cool it is<lf>that I got to watch you as you turned into<lf>the best dang hunter there is out there.
<string>But even if you got to being the best, you<lf>can always still get bester! Don't you ever<lf>stop aiming higher. I'm rootin' for ya!
<string>I've been real busy lately so I haven't<lf>been able to practice my monster<lf>impressions—wait, what!?
<string>Don't give me that look! You know like,<lf>mimicking monsters! Dude, seriously!?<lf>You forgot your training ALREADY!
<string>Anyway, I do a pretty gnarly Zinogre.<lf>Elder Fuges and Hojo were totally<lf>blown away! I would show you...
<string>...but I've had to stop doing them in<lf>the village... People might flip out,<lf>what with the Rampage and all.
<string>Yo, Ace. You ever check out the<lf>masks sold here in the Hub? Gnarly,<lf>right? I made 'em all by hand.
<string>But I haven't made a single zenny off 'em.<lf>All the kids in the village think they're too<lf>scary. They won't even go near 'em!
<string>I wanna try something else, but I'm<lf>only good at making monster masks.
<string>Hobashira said I should try to sell<lf>them somewhere else but I don't<lf>know...
<string>You think people outside of Kamura<lf>would be into monster masks?<lf>Hmmm...
<string>Yo, Ace. You've seen<lf>Taishi hanging out in front<lf>of Yomogi's shop, right?
<string>He's hoping to be an ace like you<lf>one day so I decided to take him<lf>under my wing.
<string>He's got more motivation than a monster's<lf>got teeth. So I told him to focus all that<lf>energy into eating and sleeping!
<string>Keeping your energy up is the key to<lf>a good hunt! That goes for you too.<lf>Make sure you're gettin' enough rest!
<string><VO:SER>Yoooo, Ace! You ever have any<lf>problems with the Cohoots? No!?<lf>...I think they hate me.
<string>I'll be patrolling the village just minding<lf>my own business and suddenly they<lf>just start swooping on me! What gives!?
<string>What's that? You think you know why?<lf>Well, enlighten me, 'cause I've no idea.
<string>I mean, I once did a really good<lf>Zinogre impression at the Buddy Plaza.
<string>Oh, this one time I really let one rip<lf>in the Buddy Plaza. Ha! Everyone<lf>thought a Zinogre was in the village.
<string>Wait...<lf>The Cohoots think I'm a Zinogre!?
<string>Yo, Ace. Check this out.
<string>Do you remember our talk the other day about<lf>my masks not really taking off in Kamura?<lf>Well, I took Hobashira's advice.
<string>And apparently, they've really<lf>taken off overseas—in fact, they're<lf>practically flying off the shelves!
<string>Even Rondine was raving about 'em,<lf>saying I have "stupendous sensibilities"<lf>or something like that...
<string>But I still don't know exactly why<lf>they're loving 'em so much over there.
<string>Yo, Ace! Ever scope out my gnarly set<lf>of dual blades, "Shippu" and "Jinrai"?<lf>Master Hamon made 'em just for me!
<string>I had only one request: "Spin to Win."<lf>And did he hook it up! Light as feathers<lf>and sharp as Nargacuga cutwings!
<string>The only bummer is that I go through<lf>whetstones like crazy...
<string>OK, Ace! Lesson time!
<string><NOFAC>Yo, Ace! Looks like you're starting to get<lf>the hang of this whole hunting thing, huh?
<string>Guess that means the time has come.<lf>"For what?" For some new moves, yo!<lf>And I'm gonna teach 'em to ya!
<string>They're called <COLS RED>Switch Skills</COL>! Finding the<lf>right one for your style is vital to unlocking<lf>your weapons' maximum potential!
<string>But enough talk. Go to any of your<lf><COLS RED>Item Boxes</COL>, even the one in your tent<lf>and choose Change Switch Skill.
<string>Switch Skills open up a wide world of hunting<lf>possibilities. Try out a bunch till you find<lf>one that speaks to ya!
<string>OK, Ace! Lesson time!
<string><NOFAC>Yo, Ace! I see you've been experimenting with<lf>all sorts of different weapons, huh?
<string>Seeing as you're workin' so hard,<lf>I've got some new Switch Skills to teach ya!
<string>Find the right combination, and you'll<lf>become unstoppable! Keep mixin' and<lf>matchin' until you find what's right for you!
<string>Nice job, Ace!
<string><NOFAC>Yo, Ace! Wow, you thrashed every last Arena<lf>Quest! What a champ!
<string>There are very few here in this village<lf>who've accomplished such a task. I'm<lf>about to tear up, I'm so dang proud!
<string>*ahem* As a sign of your triumph over<lf>the Arena, I will present you with this:<lf>A <COLS RED>Feather of Mastery</COL>.
<string>But don't forget, the path that a hunter<lf>walks never truly ends. Keep your tabi<lf>laced up and keep pushing!
<string>Nice job, Ace!
<string><NOFAC>Yo, Ace! Wow, you thrashed every last Arena<lf>Quest! What a champ!
<string>There are very few here in this village<lf>who've accomplished such a task. I'm<lf>about to tear up, I'm so dang proud!
<string>*ahem* As a sign of your triumph over<lf>the Arena, I will present you with this:<lf>A <COLS RED>Feather of Mastery</COL>.
<string>Huh? Looks like your Equipment Box is...<lf>full? Come back once you've freed up<lf>some space.
<string>Yo, Ace!
<string><NOFAC>Everyone's been telling me about<lf>all the big things you've been doing!
<string>So I thought I'd come up with<lf>a little something to help you out:<lf>some brand new Switch Skills!
<string>But I'm not just gonna hand 'em over like<lf>last time. Nope! You gotta earn 'em! And<lf>to earn 'em, I've prepared some quests!
<string>Just check out my little quest description<lf>and then take on the quest! Complete<lf>it and you'll gain a new skill!
<string>I was gonna draw up some charts and<lf>stuff, but then I was like, "Nah, that's<lf>lame! Let's do some quests!"
<string>*ahem* Anyway, whenever you wanna<lf>snatch up some new skills, go take on<lf>one of my quests!
<string>Yo, Ace!
<string><NOFAC>I hear you're really thrashin'<lf>up a storm out there!
<string>And I couldn't just stand around twirlin'<lf>my kunai when I could be teachin' you<lf>some gnarly new Switch Skills!
<string>And if you want some gnarly new Switch<lf>Skills, you're gonna have to take on some<lf>gnarly new challenges!
<string>But if you succeed, I guarantee you'll be<lf>stylin' and trashin' on monsters with 100%<lf>MORE style and thrash! Go give 'em a shot!
<string>Yo, Ace!
<string><NOFAC>Whoa, Ace! You've really been trashin'<lf>on those monsters out there. Startin'<lf>to look like a seasoned hunter now!
<string>But even seasoned hunters need<lf>some spicy new Switch Skills!
<string>I know you're ready to dig in, but I gotta<lf>warn ya, these new quests I cooked up<lf>have got some kick! Like, "HIYA!"
<string>Each one of 'em will put you flat<lf>on your butt if you're not ready...<lf>So you better lace up your tabi!
<string><NOFAC>Yo, Ace!<lf>Have you taken a stab at any<lf>Gathering Hub quests yet?
<string>Oh, Minoto's busy? Bummer. Yeah...<lf>Gotta report to the Guild about the Rampage.<lf>She'll have her hands tied for a while.
<string>But don't worry about all that.<lf>You just focus on getting settled<lf>in to your new hunter life!
