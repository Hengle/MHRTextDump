<string>It is I, Fukashigi the Informant,<lf>at your service...
<string>Very well. I'll impawrt to you the<lf>first dirty secret of Elgado...
<string>Dame Luchika...
<string>Is really...
<string>An unparalleled greedy-guts!
<string>She could give Kamura's own food bank,<lf>Hinoa, a run fur her zenny.
<string>But she likes to keep it under her hat.<lf>When she's out, she settles for a normal<lf>portion, but eats meowntains at home!
<string>What I can't understand is how both<lf>Hinoa and Luchika manage to put so<lf>much away but keep looking so stylish.
<string>By my whiskers, wasn't that juicy?<lf>I'll update you again once your MR<lf>has increased.
<string>It is I, Fukashigi the Informant,<lf>at your service...
<string>Very well. I'll impawrt to you the<lf>second dirty secret of Elgado...
<string>Dame Fiorayne...
<string>Is really...
<string>Crazy fur anything cutesy!
<string>That's right, Admiral Galleus's courageous<lf>second-in-command. She'd never admit it,<lf>but she's as soft as a kitten.
<string>My purr-obing has revealed that her<lf>quarters are stuffed full of soft toy<lf>meownsters and animals.
<string>No one but her sister Rondine knows.<lf>It's a closely guarded secret.
<string>By my whiskers, wasn't that juicy?<lf>I'll update you again once your MR<lf>has increased.
<string>It is I, Fukashigi the Informant,<lf>at your service...
<string>Very well. I'll impawrt to you the<lf>third dirty secret of Elgado...
<string>Sir Jae...
<string>In fact...
<string>...has an older sister he can't stand up to!
<string>My sources tell me he works out just<lf>so he has the courage to con-furr-ont<lf>his strong-willed sibling.
<string>And I've learned that Dame Luchika<lf>is the spitting image of his sister, too.
<string>The upshot is, whenever he speaks with<lf>Dame Luchika, he trembles with fear!
<string>By my whiskers, wasn't that juicy?<lf>I'll update you again once your MR<lf>has increased.
<string>It is I, Fukashigi the Informant,<lf>at your service...
<string>Very well. I'll impawrt to you the<lf>fourth dirty secret of Elgado...
<string>Master Arlow...
<string>Is in fact...
<string>From the same hometown as<lf>Admiral Galleus!
<string>Purrize pupil Admiral Galleus and the<lf>vagabond Master Arlow were the best<lf>of fur-iends in their youth, it seems.
<string>But fur some reason, their hometown<lf>no longer exists.
<string>Then they became hunters, and purroved<lf>to be a purrfect pair, each knowing<lf>exactly what the other was thinking.
<string>And today, they work to purr-otect the<lf>Kingdom as admiral and arena master,<lf>so a similar tragedy never occurs again.
<string>By my whiskers, wasn't that juicy?<lf>I'll update you again once your MR<lf>has increased.
<string>It is I, Fukashigi the Informant,<lf>at your service...
<string>Very well. I'll impawrt to you the<lf>fifth dirty secret of Elgado...
<string>Oboro the Merchant...
<string>Is really...
<string>A furst-class hunter!
<string>Oboro claims not to hunt as he objects<lf>to taking the life of any creature.<lf>But in truth, he's an expurrt hunter!
<string>Appawrently, his hidden talents match<lf>the skill of sword master Kagero.
<string>As a result, he's secretly charged with<lf>the purr-otection of Princess Chichae.
<string>But as he won't take anyone's life, he<lf>conceals about his purrson only a wooden<lf>sword. Which is sufficient, I hear.
<string>That's why he has his market where<lf>he does. To keep a close eye on the<lf>purr-incess.
<string>By my whiskers, wasn't that juicy?<lf>I'll update you again once your MR<lf>has increased.
<string>It is I, Fukashigi the Informant,<lf>at your service...
<string>Very well. I'll impawrt to you the first half<lf>of the most special secret of Elgado...
<string>Doctor Tadori...
<string>Is in fact...
<string>Having packed lunches made for him<lf>by Bahari!
<string>The doctor is fur-equently out doing<lf>field work and appears to have little<lf>interest in eating.
<string>Unable to bear seeing Tadori munching<lf>on raw herbs and mushrooms, Bahari<lf>has taken to purr-eparing him a lunch.
<string>Bahari values good nutrition and sleep<lf>very highly, and he's actually a rather<lf>accomplished cook.
<string>Whenever Doc comes to Elgado, Bahari<lf>makes sure to send him off again with a<lf>packed lunch of good, long-lasting food.
<string>It's amewsing to see the calm and<lf>collected doctor being pampurred<lf>by the eccentric Bahari.
<string>By my whiskers, wasn't that juicy?<lf>Thus concludes the first half of<lf>my most special, secret intel.
<string>It is I, Fukashigi the Informant,<lf>at your service...
<string>Very well. I'll impawrt to you the second half<lf>of the most special secret of Elgado...
<string>Princess Chichae, the Quest Damsel...
<string>In fact...
<string>Had a beautiful, long mane of hair<lf>once upon a time!
<string>Her Meowjesty, the Queen, was opposed<lf>to the purr-incess managing quests.<lf>As were the retainers.
<string>But she studied hard and qualified fur<lf>the paw-sition. She must have won them<lf>over with her determination in the end.
<string>When she was posted to Elgado, she<lf>decided to cut off her long hair to<lf>purr-ove her commitment to the job!
<string>And when the people of Elgado saw<lf>that, it touched them, and helped boost<lf>morale.
<string>By my whiskers, wasn't that juicy?<lf>Thus concludes the second half<lf>of my most special, secret intel.
