<string>I'm gonna tell everyone that<lf>we went huntin' together, Ace!
<string>I'm so proud of you, Ace!<lf>Way to thrash!
<string>Whew! What a rush!<lf>Quality stuff, Ace!
<string>Me n' Ace, thrashin' like<lf>we've never thrashed before!
<string>What's a hunt without some<lf>monsters!? Let's go find 'em!
<string>Now's the time to sharpen your<lf>weapon or fill up your stamina!
<string>Way to go, Ace!<lf>Impeccable work, as always!
<string>Wouldn't expect anything less from<lf>my favorite pupil!
<string>...Mmmhmm. Mmmhmm.
<string>Oh, uh, sorry! It's the first time to hear<lf>that compliment. I'm gonna have to use it!
<string>Way to thrash, you two!
<string>When we get back let's eat and<lf>then hit the hay! Gotta stay healthy!
<string>You're on the right path! Eatin'<lf>and snoozin' your way to success!
<string>Oh yeah? You didn't get enough? Hm...<lf>What could we do to tire you out?
<string>Ah, I know! How about<lf>a sprint back to camp!?
<string>Way to thrash, Ace! Peak performance<lf>on both offense and defense!
<string>"Couple"? You're including me, too?
<string>Y'know, I'm used to giving compliments,<lf>not taking them. Kinda embarrassing...
<string>Now I know how ya feel,<lf>Ace! Hahaha!
<string>"Still got it"!?<lf>You were huntin' circles around us!
<string>Ace, it looks like we got some trainin' to<lf>do if we wanna keep up with Elder Fugen!
<string>Way to thrash, Minoto!
<string>You know, you'd be a gnarly hunter,<lf>if you put your mind to it!
<string>Whatcha think? "Minoto the Maiden<lf>Huntress." It's got a nice ring to it!
<string>Great thinking! OK, everybody!<lf>Race ya back to camp!
<string>But no Wirebugs or Palamutes,<lf>OK! Ready...? GO!
