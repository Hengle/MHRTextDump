<string>Yo, Ace! Over here!
<string>You can't run with your weapon out.<lf>Put that thing away first!
<string>Yo, Ace!<lf>I'm on top of these boulders!
<string>No need to rush! Just take<lf>your time and aim carefully!
<string>You can also use the <COL RED>Action<lf>Bar</COL> to ride your Palamute!
<string>Press <ICON PAD_A> next to a Palamute<lf>to mount it.
<string>Lost, huh?<lf>Just take a look at your map!
<string>You ready?<lf>Come on, this way!
<string>Nicely done!
<string>Great work, Ace!<lf>Two down, one to go!
<string>Come talk to me when you're<lf>done carving!
<string>Heeeey, Ace!<lf>Come on, time to get back to camp!
<string>Yo! Come on down once<lf>you're all done up there!
<string>You just about ready?<lf>Come on over already!
<string>Still need more time practicing?<lf>Let me know when you're done.
<string>Use <COL RED>Silkbind</COL> or a <COL RED>Puppet Spider</COL><lf>to get it into a Mountable State.
<string>Now attack it or sheathe your<lf>weapon and press <ICON PAD_A> to ride!
<string>Now you're Wyvern Riding!<lf>First, try <COL RED>moving</COL>.
<string>The <COL RED>Wyvern Riding Timer</COL> shows<lf>how much longer you can ride.
<string>It ticks down over time or<lf>whenever you're attacked.
<string>Time won't decrease while we're<lf>training, but it will out in the field!
<string>Yeah, that's it Ace!<lf>Now try an <COL RED>attack</COL>.
<string>That's quite a stinger!<lf>OK, time to <COL RED>evade</COL>!
<string>You got it Ace! Now let's<lf>see you <COL RED>launch the monster</COL>!
<string>Send it careening right into<lf>an obstacle—super powerful!
<string>If you <COL RED>regain your footing</COL>, you'll<lf>be able to Launch it again!
<string>Awesome!<lf>Gnarly stuff there, Ace!
<string>Yeah! He'll be feeling<lf>that one in the morning!
<string>Now's your chance to thrash<lf>while the monster can't move!
<string>OK, on to the next one!
<string>You've got the basics down.<lf>Now try out a <COL RED>Mounted Punisher</COL>.
<string>You'll be facing off against...<lf>You guessed it! Another Arzuros!
<string>To start off, attack to max<lf>out your <COL RED>Wyvern Riding Gauge</COL>.
<string>You need a full gauge and time<lf>to spare to pull off this move!
<string>Time won't decrease while we're<lf>training, but it will out in the field!
<string>Press <ICON PAD_B> to stop an attack and<lf>evade using your Wirebug Gauge!
<string>Your gauge is full! Press <ICON PAD_X>+<ICON PAD_A><lf>to do a <COL RED>Mounted Punisher</COL>!
<string>Excellent work, Ace! That's<lf>everything you need to know!
<string>Oof, almost had him! Just make<lf>sure you nail it on the hunt!
<string>A Mounted Punisher! That'll do<lf>some BIG damage if it lands!
<string>Wyvern Riding opens up a whole<lf>new world of hunting possibilities!
<string>Don't forget to use it. And if<lf>you need practice, come on back!
<string>Yo, Ace! Come on down once<lf>you've got your items!
<string>Over here, Ace!<lf>Let's start training!
<string>OK, go get your items!<lf>Talk to me once you're ready.
<string>To start, attack the Arzuros<lf>to weaken it!
<string>Then a <COL RED>Blue Icon</COL> will display<lf>over the Target Icon!
<string>This time, I'll tell you when to<lf>throw your trap, so don't worry!
<string>OK, just a bit more!<lf>Keep wailing on it!
<string>It's not weak yet. Keep<lf>attacking until my signal!
<string>Come on, Ace!<lf>It's too early for that!
<string>If you run out of items,<lf>restock at a <COL RED>Gathering Point</COL>!
<string>Oh, that's a tired monster,<lf>alright! Quick, <COL RED>capture</COL> it!
<string>Now it's time to lay your<lf><COL RED>Trap</COL>! Either one will do.
<string>Hold it, Ace!<lf>You can't capture it if you slay it!
<string>Good work, Ace! Now <COL RED>lure<lf>the monster into the trap</COL>!
<string>Fantastic! Alright, it's time<lf>for a <COL RED>Tranq Bomb</COL>!
<string>Just <COL RED>keep lobbing bombs</COL><lf>at it until it falls asleep!
<string>That's not quite it, Ace.<lf>OK, set up another trap!
<string>If you run out of items,<lf>restock at a <COL RED>Gathering Point</COL>!
<string>Wow! Great job, Ace! That was<lf>a textbook capture!
<string>The key to capturing is to<lf><COL RED>observe your target carefully</COL>!
<string>Learn to see exactly when a<lf>monster has been weakened!
<string>Good job... *ahem* But you were<lf>supposed to capture it...
<string>If your goal is to capture a<lf>monster, you can't slay it.
<string>But hey, we're just practicing.<lf>Come back and try again any time!
<string>Enter the Stronghold<lf>when you're ready!
<string>Yo! Ace! Enter the Stronghold<lf>once you're ready!
<string>Hey, Ace! Over here, I'll give<lf>you the rundown!
<string>Over here, Ace!<lf>Let's set up an Installation!
<string>Alright, ready a <COL RED>Ballista</COL>!
<string>Hunters can <COL RED>mount</COL> Ballistae<lf>and attack monsters with them!
<string>I'll tell you more about<lf>using Ballistae later.
<string>Alright, how about you set up<lf>the next Hunting Installation?
<string>OK. Next, set up a <COL RED>Defender<lf>Ballista</COL> here!
<string>Defender Ballistae allow<lf>villagers to attack monsters!
<string>After all, one hunter can only<lf>manage so many Installations.
<string>So, let's let a villager take<lf>over and set up the next one!
<string>Hmm, how about... Yeah, let's<lf>set up a <COL RED>Bamboo Bomb</COL> here!
<string>Bamboo Bombs will detonate once<lf>monsters get close enough!
<string>Set 'em up in front of a horde<lf>to stop 'em in their tracks!
<string>I think we've set up every<lf>basic Hunting Installation!
<string>It's about time I explained<lf>the details of <COL RED>Ballistae</COL> usage.
<string>Come on! Over here, Ace!
<string>Now go to the Ballista you set up<lf>and press <ICON PAD_A> to <COL RED>mount</COL> it!
<string><COL RED>Ballistae</COL> are Installations<lf>that fire quickly at foes.
<string>First, press <ICON PAD_A> or <OPT ZR> to fire<lf>a <COL RED>Ballista Shot</COL>!
<string>The displayed number indicates<lf>the amount of shots remaining.
<string>After a certain time, it will <COL RED>auto-<lf>reload</COL> when you're out of ammo.
<string>Nice! Next up, we've got<lf>the <COL RED>Crag Shot</COL>. Press <ICON PAD_X> to fire!
<string>Crag Shot is a special ammo<lf>that can <COL RED>stun</COL> monsters.
<string>You gotta aim for <COL RED>their<lf>head</COL> though!
<string>Next, try firing off a <COL RED>Retreat<lf>Shot</COL> by pressing <ICON PAD_Y>!
<string>Land the hit, there's a good chance<lf>you'll <COL RED>knock back</COL> the monster!
<string>Crag and Retreat Shots are<lf>strong, but you gotta time 'em!
<string>OK, now try <COL RED>Guarding</COL><lf>by holding <OPT RT>!
<string>Just as you're about to be hit<lf>by a monster, quickly guard!
<string>Doing so will reduce damage<lf>and prevent knockback!
<string>And that's it!<lf>You're now a Ballista pro!
<string>That's enough. Go ahead and<lf>dismount by pressing <ICON PAD_B>.
<string>Can you feel that? That's<lf>the <COL RED>Rampage approaching</COL>.
<string>Set up more Hunting Installations<lf>on other Platforms!
<string>I'm returning to my position,<lf>but I'll keep an eye on you!
<string>That's a <COL RED>Stalker</COL> type!
<string>They'll seek out hunters,<lf>so watch your back!
<string>Good work, Ace!<lf>You repelled the monster!
<string>Looks like a <COL RED>Targeter</COL> type!
<string>They keep their distance and<lf>use long range attacks!
<string>Hey, not bad, Ace! At this rate,<lf>the Stronghold will be fine!
<string>This one is a <COL RED>Gate Crasher</COL> type!
<string>They focus on the gates. Leave<lf>'em alone and we're toast!
<string>Good job, Ace!<lf>The gates are still intact!
<string>When using a Ballista, it's best<lf>to aim for the <COL RED>monster's head</COL>!
<string>If an Installation is down,<lf>just wait a bit or redeploy it!
<string>The final gate's status is shown<lf>in the top right of the minimap!
<string>If you don't need an installation,<lf>hold <ICON PAD_A> to <COL RED>dismantle</COL> it!
<string>Oof... Looks like they're<lf>sending in every type at once.
<string>With everything you've learned,<lf>I'm sure you can take 'em!
<string>Wow, Ace! The <COL RED>Stronghold<lf>Level</COL> increased!
<string>You got new Installations and your<lf>shots' firepower has increased!
<string>There it is! The horde's <COL RED>Major<lf>Threat</COL> is here.
<string>They're really big and really<lf>powerful! Get ready!
<string>This power! That must mean...<lf>a <COL RED>Counter Signal</COL> was fired!
<string>Grab your weapon and <COL RED>attack<lf>the monsters directly</COL>!
<string>Gnarly! You repelled the first horde!<lf>You can come down now.
<string>Great job, Ace! You drove off<lf>that Major Threat with ease!
<string>Once a horde has fled, you'll<lf>have a break before the next wave.
<string>Make use of this time<lf>to prepare!
<string>Alright, head that way and<lf>I'll explain everything!
<string>Aaace! Over here!<lf>Start getting ready!
<string>WHOO! I'm burning up!<lf>Time to get to it!
<string>That sounded like Elder Fugen!<lf>Ace! Over here!
<string>Come on, Ace! This way!
<string>Ace! The <COL RED>second horde</COL> is<lf>almost here!
<string>I'm returning to my post, but<lf>you should be fine on your own!
<string>Now, get out there and defend<lf>the Stronghold as you see fit!
<string>How 'bout some Installations<lf>to beef up our defenses, Ace?
<string>Alright, Ace! Second horde's<lf>coming! Get ready to thrash!
<string>During Rampage quests, the Guild<lf>will post <COL RED>sub-assignments</COL>!
<string>Complete them to raise your <COL RED>Reward<lf>Rank</COL> and <COL RED>Stronghold Level</COL>.
<string>Once you've got the hang of<lf>things, give them a shot.
<string>You can see more on your sub-<lf>assignments in Quest Info!
<string>The final <COL RED>Major Threat</COL> of this<lf>horde has appeared!
<string><COL RED>Slay</COL> it or protect the final gate until<lf>the end to repel the Rampage!
<string>Hey, that's was something else!<lf>I knew we could count on you!
<string>The final gate...! No use<lf>crying about it. Retreat!
<string>There's always next time, Ace!
<string>Wow! Great job, Ace!<lf>Kamura is safe, thanks to you!
<string>Remember everything you learned<lf>here today for the next one!
<string>As long as you're on the job,<lf>we could best 100 Rampages!
