<string>Johoho, I smell a Rampage!<lf>Ready to get to it-to it!?
<string>You did it-did it!<lf>What a huge success!
<string>This is terrible!<lf>Everyone, time to leg it-leg it!
<string>Well, I think that will do!<lf>Back to town for now!
<string>Shame about the Stronghold,<lf>but a win is a win...
<string>Johoho! Mission complete!<lf>That's how you do it-do it!
<string>How many missions complete?<lf>All of them!? Marvelous!
<string>Guess what? A new mission! I<lf>know you can do it-do it!
<string>A horde is coming!<lf>Hold your ground—for Kamura!
<string>The next wave is almost here!<lf>Time to get ready!
<string>This is the last wave!<lf>Put your back into it-to it!
<string>A gate is being attacked!<lf>Hold fast!
<string>How could this happen?<lf>Our defenses, destroyed!?
<string>The beasts are here and they're<lf>more ferocious than imaginable!
<string>The final gate is being attacked!<lf>This is...not good!
<string>The final gate has been weakened...<lf>We can't let it fall! Hop to it-to it!
<string>That Gate Breaker aims to destroy<lf>the Stronghold! It mustn't!
<string>That Stalker is after our<lf>hunters! Be careful!
<string>Look alive—that slimeball Targeter<lf>is attacking from a distance!
<string>Wind Serpent ahoy! I repeat:<lf>Ibushi has been sighted!
<string>The threat is closing in! Make<lf>sure none of them get past us!
<string>Wha—!? A perilous beast<lf>makes its way here!
<string>Johoho, I can feel it!<lf>I'm ready to leap into action!
<string>This power is overwhelming!<lf>Time for an all-out attack!
<string>Installation down!<lf>Not to worry, will fix it-fix it!
<string>An Apex! Let's drive it away<lf>and call it a day!
<string>The Apex is about to attack!<lf>Oh-ho-nooo—!
<string>This attack... Oh my, it's more<lf>ferocious than I thought!
<string>That roar's made the horde<lf>even angrier!
<string>Wrecked our Stronghold, hmmm!?<lf>Oh, now I'm really mad!
<string>Went splat, did you!?<lf>Get it together then get back to it-to it!
<string>Johoho! That installation<lf>right there, that's the one!
<string>Oh my... What a poor<lf>performance.
<string>Way to put in the work! Almost<lf>as much as us defenders! Johoho!
<string>Johoho, what a show!<lf>It's got our blood boiling too!
<string>Nicely done, <PL>,<lf>Fine hunter, you are!
<string>Dispatch that calamity,<lf>Hunter of Kamura! Johoho!
<string>We're counting on you,<lf><PL>!
<string>Defenders, put your back into-to it!<lf>Send this Rampage packing!
