<string>......<lf>You need something?
<string>Kinda busy here, if you don't mind.<lf>Go bother Pingarh. I'm sure he's<lf>got plenty of time to talk to you...
<string>OK, then. Goodbye.
<string>Singing AGAIN? Ugh... What is with that<lf>guy? Did he get hit in the head with a sail<lf>boom when he was a kid or something?
<string>"yO-hO-hOooOo~♪ SiNgInG mAkEs tHE<lf>dAy gO bY fAsTeR..." I mean, yeah,<lf>maybe for YOU!
<string>Honestly, it's not that singing that rubs<lf>me the wrong way. It's that he does it<lf>while not doing anything! ARGHHHH!
<string>*sigh* I was wondering why we had to<lf>weigh anchor again after JUST getting<lf>into port... Back to Kamura, huh?
<string>...In that case, can you take that<lf>layabout Pingarh with you?
<string>I mean, just look at him. He's a total<lf>distraction. That incessant singing...<lf>That awful...awful singing...
<string>Welcome back, Hunter. How was your trip?<lf>Any issues with your ship? ...No? Good.
<string>It's hard to concentrate with "yO-hO-hOo"<lf>blaring in your ear, so I worried I might've<lf>blundered somewhere.
<string>Pingarh told me to loosen up—whistle<lf>while I work, and all that. But I can't<lf>be careless in any of my preparations.
<string>I can't risk the lives of my passengers,<lf>just because I was concentrating on my<lf>"yo's" and "ho's" instead of my work.
<string>I've been shadowing Pingarh lately,<lf>thinking I could learn something from<lf>the way he "works." *sigh*
<string>All I've learned by this point is what<lf>a charmed life that guy lives...
<string>When my work here is done, I'll go<lf>back to my post.
<string>That is if I can get it done. Kinda<lf>hard when you have to deal with—<lf>You know what? Forget about it...
<string>I could tolerate a rotation of songs,<lf>but that guy sticks to the same tune.<lf>I'm pretty sick of it, let me tell you.
<string>I wouldn't make such a stink about<lf>it if he just kept his tunes to himself<lf>and got some work done...
<string>You know, it's times like these that<lf>I wish I could be of more use...
<string>I could probably do a lot more to help<lf>if I wasn't stuck pickin' up Pingarh's<lf>slack all the time!
<string>Sometimes—just sometimes, mind<lf>you—I imagine having a laid-back<lf>life like Pingarh's.
<string>But then I immediately come to my<lf>senses, realize that'll never happen,<lf>and get back to work.
<string>In a sense, having a guy like him around<lf>is a sort of negative reinforcement. Not<lf>that I give him that much credit. Heh.
<string>We got an order to make sure all ships<lf>are in tiptop shape and ready to depart.
<string>Looks like the research teams are onto<lf>something. Guess, that's thanks to you,<lf>huh?
<string>Things are going to get hectic, especially<lf>since there's a lot of slack to pick up from<lf>you-know-who... *sigh*
<string>Between you and me... Sometimes I find<lf>myself buying into what Pingarh says...
<string>I'm starting to second guess myself...<lf>Maybe his daily influence is starting<lf>to rub off on me.
<string>Wait, does that mean I've been wrong<lf>this whole time? Nah, no way...
<string>Unforeseen circumstances... Means there's<lf>no telling when they'll happen. This mission<lf>could be one such example.
<string>I know it's strange to get a warning<lf>from a deck hand like me, but, well...<lf>Do be careful out there, Hunter.
<string>What's up with the researchers?<lf>I've never seen them like this before...
<string>They barely said a word, like, something<lf>had scared the living daylights out of 'em.
<string>I wanted to ask about what happened,<lf>but they looked like they'd freak out if<lf>I did, so I just left 'em alone...
<string>Ahoy, Hunter—Ugh... Startin' to sound<lf>like that guy... Anyway, the ship's<lf>always ready to go whenever you are.
<string>I love it here in Elgado and the people<lf>are great, with one exception... *ahem*<lf>It's the least I can do to help out.
<string>Everyone's been talking about Malzeno.<lf>And seeing how it's making the Order<lf>nervous is making ME nervous...
<string>But now's not the time for panic!<lf>Everyone...should *gulp* be calm.<lf>Just...be c-calm...
<string>You'd think that with Malzeno out of<lf>the picture, things would slow down<lf>here a bit...
<string>I guess things are just getting started.<lf>And that means we're gonna be real<lf>busy. Well...
<string>I'M gonna be busy because songbird<lf>over there won't get the lead out...
<string>Um... Did you hear about Pingarh?<lf>He rejected a post at Guild HQ, to<lf>join the investigation here in Elgado...
<string>What a waste... But is it? Man, I don't<lf>even know any more...
<string>All I know is I've lost faith in my own<lf>work ethic and I have no idea what<lf>I should do now...
<string>Can you believe it? Everything's in<lf>perfect shape! Pingarh put the<lf>finishing touches on in record time!
<string>He may act the way he does, but when<lf>you get down to brass tacks, I hardly<lf>hold a candle to him.
<string>Man... If he worked like this all the time,<lf>a guy might even come to respect him...
<string>Pingarh's back to singing again...<lf>I guess you could say I've gotten<lf>used to it.
<string>Well, there's no point in complaining<lf>about it. Thanks to him, I've learned<lf>all kinds of things.
<string>Even if those things are things<lf>NOT to do. Heh.
<string>Why am I working so hard on this little<lf>boat? *sigh* It's not the size that counts,<lf>it's the motion—
<string>Look. Not every place you sail to is<lf>gonna roll out the red carpet for you<lf>and have a place to park your boat.
<string>You gotta rely on dinghies like this if you<lf>wanna make landfall. Otherwise you're gonna<lf>be swimming, and hunters don't swim!
<string>When am I ever gonna finish with this<lf>boat? Huh? OH! You think I've been<lf>working on the same boat!? Hahaha!
<string>I guess to the untrained eye they all look<lf>the same, but trust me, the Guild has<lf>a whole fleet of these bad boys.
<string>That man's singing... I hear it every day.<lf>Even in my dreams, at this point.
<string>Just last night, he held a recital on<lf>deck, lit by an imposing moon overhead.<lf>Just thinking about it gives me shivers.
<string>Best keep that earworm out of your life,<lf>Hunter. If you value your nights, that is.
<string>I heard a rumor the other day, can't tell<lf>the truth of it, if I'm honest. I mean,<lf>it sounds pretty fishy.
<string>I heard Pingarh was supposedly on the<lf>fast track to success at the capital before<lf>coming to Elgado. Can you believe it?
<string>If it's true, and some mistake got him<lf>demoted to the field... I'd feel bad for<lf>the guy. Still, can't ask him directly.
<string>"Hmm-hmmm-hmm-hmm ♪ Hm-hmm-<lf>hmm-hmm treasuuure ♪ A reward for<lf>true hearts, and heroic endeavooors!~♪"
<string>Ah! He's got me singing that weird<lf>Spelunker song!
<string>Uh, do me a favor, would you?<lf>Pretend you didn't hear anything.
<string>Getting the new ship ready was<lf>a thrilling experience! I'm still<lf>shaking with excitement.
<string>By being a part of it, I feel like I've<lf>figured out a pretty significant life goal.
<string>And to hit that goal, I'll need to start<lf>by putting my nose to the grindstone.<lf>I'll polish my skill, one day at a time!
