<string>A song drifts softly over snowy soil.
<string>Bewitching and seducing all those<lf>unfortunate enough to be in earshot.
<string>And before they even sense it,<lf>they find themselves frozen to the bone.
<string>Helpless, as their life is drained away.
<string>How the song ends, they will never know.
<string>For this minstrel shall never refrain.
<string>Seductive Siren
<string>Aurora Somnacanth
