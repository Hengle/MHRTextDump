<string>Oh, <PL>.<lf>Need somethin'?
<string>Actually, mind if we do this later?<lf>I have a shipment comin' in<lf>that I need to take care of.
<string>Ah, <PL>.<lf>Surprised to see you here.<lf>Somethin' you need?
<string>I'm just checkin' for goods<lf>to stock up on while I wait<lf>for the next ship to arrive.
<string>Gotta be ready for the Rampage.<lf>It'll be a real mess if we aren't!
<string>Ah, <PL>.<lf>I see you've become a hunter!<lf>Congratulations to you.
<string>The Rampage is causing a bit of a mess,<lf>but don't worry about us. We'll do what<lf>we can to keep trade going.
<string>Speaking of, looks like a ship's coming in.<lf>I better go take inventory.

<string>Bunny Dango are a huge deal<lf>for Kamura! Our main money-maker,<lf>second only to our steel.
<string>The chefs and tea dealers are<lf>nice enough to provide us here<lf>with dango we can eat cold.
<string>Those're tasty, sure, but nothing<lf>compares to the stuff fresh out<lf>of the kitchen, I tell ya.
<string>Once the Rampage calms down<lf>and folks can come 'n' go how<lf>they please...
<string>I hope more people'll get the chance<lf>to try some freshly steamed Bunny<lf>Dango, just the way they should be.

<string>If the Rampage gets any worse,<lf>who knows what'll happen?
<string>I mean, we're still getting shipments<lf>in right now, but our trade route<lf>could be cut off at any time.
<string>We should prepare for the worst...
<string>The Rampage is beginnin' to affect<lf>our logistics. Well, it's only ships<lf>comin' in later right now, but still...
<string>I figured we did everything we could<lf>to prevent this from happenin', but<lf>I guess it simply wasn't enough.
<string>A while back, Master Hamon asked<lf>me to find and import some farming<lf>and manufacturing materials.
<string>It was for his usual work, of course,<lf>but who knows?
<string>Maybe some of those materials ended up<lf>playin' a role in him making this "device"<lf>of his! Would be mighty proud if they did!

<string>Master Hojo's a real good artist y'know.<lf>I convinced him to go commercial,<lf>and exported some of his works.
<string>They sold out faster than Lagombi<lf>mittens in the winter! The Master's<lf>got fans, that's for sure.
<string>I hear Minoto's been drawing too,<lf>but I don't think she's confident<lf>in her abilities yet.
<string>I asked about getting her work<lf>out on the market, but she flat<lf>out refused. Too bad...
<string>Hmmm... Mmm, now this is—<lf>Mm...ngh!? *cough cough*
<string>*cough* *hack*<lf>Uh-<PL>!<lf>'Scuse me, didn't see you there.
<string>I was just sampling a potential import;<lf>a specialty where it's from, I hear.
<string>It was pretty good. I almost choked<lf>on it, but it was tasty nonetheless.
<string>Maybe I oughta buy a few<lf>to share with other folks.
<string>You know the flowers Hanamori<lf>grows? The seeds're pretty<lf>popular outside Kamura.
<string>Only problem's that they're on<lf>the fragile side and they don't<lf>do too well on long trips.
<string>There's gotta be a better way to export<lf>'em... I oughta brainstorm with Hanamori<lf>once I finish unloadin' all this cargo.

<string>Have you met Rondine yet? Y'know,<lf>the lady over at the Buddy Plaza?
<string>I hear she's a trader, and one from<lf>a land really, REALLY far away at that.
<string>Now, I meet a lot of foreign merchants<lf>in my line of work, but she's...different<lf>from the usual ones.
<string>I'd love to hear more about overseas<lf>though, and have her get to know more<lf>about Kamura while she's here.
<string>I've heard a massive horde's comin', and<lf>so have the merchants, apparently.
<string>The crew from the last boat that<lf>came in were quick to unload their<lf>cargo, and left in an awful hurry.
<string>I can't thank them enough though,<lf>bringing in our goods even though<lf>they must be positively terrified.

<string><PL>, have you seen<lf>Master Utsushi's masks up for sale<lf>over in the Gathering Hub?
<string>I gotta say, Utsushi has an, uh...<lf>interestin' style. One that most<lf>in this village probably don't share.
<string>And yet, when I showed 'em to a foreign<lf>merchant, he seemed interested, so<lf>I exported a few just for the heck of it.
<string>Turns out they were wildly popular and<lf>were flyin' off the shelves left and right.
<string>What a huge world we live in, with<lf>such different cultures and tastes...

<string>Off to hunt Ibushi?
<string>The Rampage threatens not only<lf>Kamura's physical safety but also<lf>the village's economic security.
<string>Our trade might be holding out now,<lf>but... I just hope you can put a stop<lf>to that threat before it worsens.
<string>Heard you beat Ibushi, <PL>.<lf>That's... Well, it's amazing!
<string>I hope this makes it easier for both<lf>boats and people to come 'n' go.
<string>Thank you. As always.
<string>It's too bad the Rampage hasn't ended...<lf>Though thankfully, it hasn't affected<lf>the shipping lanes so far.
<string>And...this isn't exactly good form,<lf>but some items are more sought<lf>after when the Rampage is on.
<string>So, y'know... It's not all bad<lf>from a trade standpoint.
<string>I think we're all good to go;<lf>we've got everything we need.
<string>But I won't be restin' just yet,<lf>what with all the extra emergency<lf>supplies we still need.
<string>So don't worry, we'll tend to the village.<lf>You just take care out there.
<string>Foreign merchants are always tellin' me<lf>about all these great heroes out there<lf>from all these places far 'n' wide...
<string>But I think you just might be<lf>the best of 'em, <PL>.
<string>Ever think of writin' an autobiography?<lf>I've got a sneakin' suspicion it'd sell<lf>pretty well, y'know.

<string>Hmm... Good. Looks like all the supplies<lf>are here, and ready.
<string>...Hm? What supplies? The food<lf>and drink for your welcome-back<lf>party, of course!
<string>It seems you're ready as well.<lf>OK then, I'll go and start<lf>unpacking the goods.
<string>Some of the traders from abroad have<lf>already heard that you got rid of the<lf>Rampage. Word sure travels fast.
<string>Trade is already picking up, and<lf>business at our docks along with it.
<string>Things will be getting busy again,<lf>but hey—I'm not about to complain.
<string>Tatara Steel is highly valued abroad.<lf>I'd say it's our number one export,<lf>without a doubt.
<string>That means it's important to keep<lf>the manufacturin' process a secret,<lf>so we maintain control of the market.
<string>But I'm told that even if it did<lf>leak, there's no-one who can<lf>replicate Master Hamon's technique.
<string>Difficult to realize how great someone<lf>is when you see them every day, huh?

<string>Tsuriki's nothin' short of amazing,<lf>carryin' around a ton of goods to every<lf>part of the village, every single day.
<string>And we've been gettin' more 'n' more<lf>cargo in, so I asked him, why not<lf>bring in some help?
<string>But he wouldn't have it. "The village<lf>is busy fightin' the Rampage, and<lf>that takes priority!" he says.
<string>He's not wrong there, but...I can't help<lf>wantin' to cut the kid some slack.

<string>Tsuriki's father lives abroad, and<lf>keeps sendin' back all sorts of stuff.
<string>It's thoughtful, sure, but I haven't<lf>the slightest idea how and where<lf>he gets all these things.
<string>There's no way he coulda got all this<lf>stuff by trading. How in the world does<lf>he get his hands on—
<string>......
<string>Y'know what? Let's not think about it.<lf>I...don't wanna worry Tsuriki. So let's<lf>keep this between us, OK?
