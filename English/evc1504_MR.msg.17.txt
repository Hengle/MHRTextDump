<string>With a fearsome leap, the hunter<lf>thinks its prey vanquished.
<string>But what it finds are not<lf>the spoils of victory...
<string>But discarded armor,<lf>shed like a husk.
<string>And when the beast finds<lf>its next target...
<string>It doesn't think twice about leaving<lf>its old shell behind.
<string>It finds new armor to don,<lf>its blades as deadly as ever.
<string>Those who oppose it have no choice<lf>but to atone with their lives.
