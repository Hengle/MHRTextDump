<string>Welcome!
<string><NOFAC><CAM:0>Oh, <PL>!
<string><VO:SP1>Hey, I heard the good news! You're<lf>a certified hunter now! Recognized by<lf>the Guild and everything! Congrats!
<string><VO:NOR>Before you head out on a hunt,<lf>make sure you stop by and eat<lf>some Bunny Dango!
<string>You'll never taste anything yummier<lf>in your life, AND they'll get your<lf>juices flowing for a hunt!
<string><NPC:35>Yomogi's Bunny Dango really<lf>are yummy. So yummy, in fact,<lf>I can't stop eating them on the job.
<string>Ooh, just thinking about them...<lf>Gets me all...excited, and—
<string>*ahem* Yomogi, the usual!<lf>Please and thank you!
<string><NPC:4>Of course, Hinoa! One super-duper<lf>mega dango order, coming right up!
<string><NPC:35><VO:SP1><PL>, I had a<lf>great time on our shopping trip.<lf>Thanks for accompanying me.
<string><CAM:3><VO:NOR>I had the things I ordered from<lf>Master Hamon and Kagero<lf>delivered to your <COLS RED>Item Box</COL>.
<string>Surprise! It's just a little something<lf>from me to celebrate you becoming<lf>a hunter!
<string>Come back when you're done<lf>with your registration thingy, 'K?
<string><CAM:0>Huh?<lf>What about the Bunny Dango?
<string>Sorry, those are all mine! I'd share<lf>but a girl's gotta eat. Hehehe.
<string><NPC:4>Hey, you should equip a weapon<lf>already! I want to see what you look<lf>like in your full hunter getup!
<string><EQUIP><NPC:35><VO:SP1>Great idea! How about you try<lf>on that long sword I just got ya!
<string><CAM:2><NPC:4><VO:SP1>So cool...!<lf>That gear really suits you, <PL>!
<string><CAM:4,1><NPC:35><VO:NOR>You must feel a ton braver now, right?<lf>Ride that high over to the Gathering Hub<lf>and get yourself registered as a hunter.
<string>Once you talk to Master Hojo<lf>and get registered...
<string>You can start going out on real<lf>live hunts as a real live Hunter<lf>of Kamura! Exciting!
<string><CAM:4,0><VO:SP1>I have to wait here for my order, so...<lf>Off you go! I'll be in my usual spot,<lf>come see me when you're done!
<string>WORST. NEWS. EVER!
<string><NOFAC><FCAM><PL>!<lf>Have you heard?<lf>Have you heard the terrible news!?
<string>This is a real emergency—OW!
<string><VO:SER>Ugh... I bith my tongue. Owww...
<string><VO:NOR>Oh, right! The news! A <COLS RED>Great Izuchi</COL><lf>is tearing up the Shrine Ruins.<lf>It's absolute carnage!
<string>OK, slight exaggeration, but there really is<lf>a Great Izuchi! And it's parked its stupid<lf>monster butt right on our main trade route.
<string>Please you gotta get rid of it!<lf>If you don't, my supply of dango<lf>ingredients won't get delivered.
<string>...Please?
<string>Oh, thank you so much!<lf>I love you!
<string>OK, OK! Hunting that Great Izuchi<lf>is now an <COLS RED>urgent quest</COL> that you<lf>can accept from Hinoa.
<string><NOFAC><FCAM>Thank you so much for getting<lf>rid of that dumb Great Izuchi!
<string>My supplies were delivered safe and sound.<lf>You can imagine how relieved Hinoa is, that<lf>crazy girl was more worried than I was!
<string><VO:SER>Anyway, the merchant who delivered the<lf>supplies said something strange before<lf>leaving the village.
<string>Something about feeling a "strange presence"<lf>in the Shrine Ruins and that it doesn't seem<lf>to be related to the Rampage.
<string>That freaked me out a little... As if<lf>those ruins could get any creepier...<lf>*shudder*
<string><VO:NOR>Oh, I almost forgot! Here, take this!<lf>It's a little thank you for helping us.<lf>I hope I can count on you again!
<string><NOFAC><FCAM>Hey, <PL>.<lf>Aren't you supposed to be shopping<lf>with Hinoa?
<string>Come on now! Didn't your mother teach<lf>you any manners!? You can't just keep<lf>your friends waiting on you all day!
<string>You shouldn't be hanging out here<lf>anyway! I'm busy! Stop making Hinoa<lf>wait for you! Now scram! Shoo!
<string><NOFAC><FCAM>Wow! Now that you have a weapon,<lf>you look like a real hunter!
<string>And once Master Hojo gives you your<lf>permit, you can work like a real hunter!<lf>Why don't you head on over?
<string>Hey, <PL>!<lf>Look at you, a real hunter!
<string>Now that you're a real hunter, don't forget<lf>to eat some Bunny Dango before you go<lf>out, OK!? I look forward to serving you!
<string>It's been pretty tough since the<lf>Rampage started. We've all been<lf>training our butts off in preparation!
<string>Poor Master Hamon has been working night<lf>and day to supply us with weapons. Every-<lf>one's tired, but now that you're a hunter...
<string>I feel like if we can actually do this! All our<lf>hard work will pay off if we work together<lf>and no one does teamwork like Kamura!
<string>It's been pretty tough since the<lf>Rampage started. We've all been<lf>training our butts off in preparation!
<string>Poor Master Hamon has been working night<lf>and day to supply us with weapons. Every-<lf>one's tired, but now that you're a hunter...
<string>I feel like we can actually do this! All our<lf>hard work will pay off if we work together,<lf>and no one does teamwork like Kamura!
<string><PL>! Please help us!<lf>Take down that Great Izuchi so<lf>my supplies can be delivered!
<string>If my supplies aren't delivered, then<lf>I can't make Bunny Dango for the<lf>Villagers! And that's super-duper bad!
<string>Please, <PL>!<lf>Get out there and hunt that Great Izuchi!
<string>I'm so glad you saved my supplies, but...
<string>I keep thinking about what the merchant<lf>said about the weird presence in the<lf>Shrine Ruins... What does that mean!?
<string><VO:SER>Gh-Ghosts!?
<string>N-No way, right? But, you know,<lf>there was once a famous god<lf>that resided in that shrine.
<string>Now the place has been trashed by<lf>monsters and the shrine is no more.<lf>I don't think the god's still there.
<string>M-Maybe there ARE ghosts...!
<string><VO:SER>Oh, no! Iori's Buddies have<lf>run off to the Shrine Ruins!<lf>I wonder if it's my fault...
<string>I caused all that trouble with the ghost<lf>nonsense and upset the Buddies.<lf>I should apologize to Iori.
<string>I hope everyone comes back safe!<lf><PL>, we're counting on<lf>you to hunt down that Aknosom.
<string><VO:SER>Me and my big mouth...
<string>I caused all that trouble saying there<lf>were ghosts in the Ruins. Now all<lf>the children in the village are scared.
<string>I want to make up for it and work<lf>out what's going on! But Master Hojo<lf>looked at me all scary so I gave up...
<string>Still, something's definitely happening<lf>over there and we need to know.<lf>Especially if it's not the Rampage.
<string>Finally! The Rampage is here!<lf>I'll be defending with my heavy bowgun!
<string>But I'm kind of worried about being<lf>near the Shrine Ruins, with all the<lf>spooky stuff going on there!
<string>Anyway, overthinking it isn't going to help<lf>anything! I should just concentrate on<lf>chasing down those monsters.
<string>When it's over, let's come home<lf>together, <PL>, OK?
<string>That...Marshmallow—no... Mangalo? Grrrr!<lf>These names are too hard! Stupid monsters!<lf>They're scary and I hate them! Anyway...
<string><VO:SER>Did you hear what Elder Fugen said?<lf>I didn't get it at all. "Kamura is more<lf>than steel and hunters"!?
<string>What does that even mean!? Isn't that<lf>what Kamura is all about? How else<lf>would we defend the village!?
<string>If we don't fend off monsters with hunters<lf>and steel, the village will be in danger,<lf>right? Grrrr! I just don't get it!
<string><VO:SER>So, all that spooky stuff going down<lf>at the Shrine Ruins was really Magna-<lf>whats-its-face?
<string>It has all that vapor stuff on it, right?<lf>I can totally see why people thought<lf>it was a ghost.
<string>But it's way scarier than any ghost.<lf>That thing could've eaten us all!<lf>Talk about a close call.
<string>Master Hamon has made an amazing<lf>device to stop that Magna-monster!
<string>Hamon always comes through<lf>with his amazing smithy skills<lf>and stuff!
<string>Hmm...?
<string>Is that what Elder Fugen meant by<lf>"...more than steel and hunters"?
<string>Hamon isn't hunting but he still<lf>works hard to protect the village.
<string>I think I'm starting to get what<lf>Elder Fugen meant...
<string>Master Hamon protected the village<lf>with his smithy skill and ingenuity,<lf>NOT a weapon!
<string>We'll come back to that later. What<lf>do you say we prepare for the hunt by<lf>having some delicious Bunny Dango?
<string>Tehehe!
<string>It's time for Magnamalo!
<string>That's right. M-A-G-N-A-M-A-L-O!<lf>I got that stupid monster's name right!
<string>Us villagers are going to take on<lf>the horde while you teach that<lf>Magnamalo a lesson or two!
<string>Now you'll have to excuse me, I've<lf>got a whole village to feed! We can't<lf>fight on an empty stomach!
<string>I've always loved my job here<lf>at the Tea Shop, but now I'm<lf>starting to love it even more!
<string>It's so rewarding to see everyone<lf>enjoying the taste of my food.<lf>The smiles! The sounds!
<string>It's even more rewarding knowing<lf>that I'm helping you help those in<lf>need! So, please, eat up! Eat up!
<string>I may not be a hunter or use steel<lf>to fight, but this is what I can do<lf>to protect Kamura!
<string>A very unusual monster has emerged<lf>from the mountains. Almoo...Alma?<lf>Nevermind. I give up...
<string>It's a dumb name anyway, so whatever!<lf>Just chow down on some Bunny Dango<lf>and get hunting!
<string>Today's Bunny Dango are<lf>super-duper yummy!
<string>You know, when Magnamalo showed<lf>up, I thought I should go on the hunt<lf>with everyone to protect the village.
<string>But I'm not strong like you, and<lf>I'm not a hunter. I felt helpless<lf>that I couldn't contribute...
<string>But now I know how I can help!<lf>And that's by making sure everyone<lf>is well fed with my delicious food!
<string>This is how I protect the village!<lf>But I still kinda hope to be<lf>a hunter one day... Kidding!
<string>I heard that you've started taking<lf>on Gathering Hub quests.
<string>Otemai, who runs the Gathering<lf>Hub Tea Shop, taught me everything<lf>I know! She's a true artist!
<string>She's also the one who helped me come up<lf>with Bunny Dango! Our menus are the same<lf>but taste slightly different. Could you tell?
<string>I heard there's a Rampage quest<lf>at the Hub. I'll be protecting<lf>the Stronghold as a defender!
<string>One shot with my heavy bowgun and<lf>*BOOM* those monsters will scatter!
<string>Now make sure to eat up before you<lf>head out! You'll need your energy!
<string>Master Hojo said you did real good<lf>at the Stronghold. He was singing—<lf>croaking?—your praises!
<string>I totally panicked when all those<lf>monsters ran out. I just screamed<lf>and kept shooting my bowgun.
<string>My aim was totally off. That's why<lf>you can't panic on the battlefield.<lf>Next time I've got to stay calm.
<string>You took down Tetranadon!<lf>Great work!
<string>They look kinda...cute, don't you think?<lf>I don't know what it is, but for some<lf>reason it reminds me of Master Hojo!
<string>Maybe if I were a monster too,<lf>we could have been friends!<lf>RAWR! Teeheehee!
<string>The threat of the Rampage is growing<lf>more and more intense, yet your<lf>efforts are putting everyone at ease.
<string>Can I tell you something? I think<lf>one day YOU could be Village Elder.<lf>We need someone like you.
<string>How about it, "Elder <PL>"!?<lf>It's got a nice ring to it!
<string>I heard people shouting "Apex!" at the<lf>Gathering Hub. Apparently this Apex<lf>has appeared with the Rampage.
<string>I thought you'd just have to defeat it<lf>and the other monsters around it<lf>would run away, but apparently not.
<string>Apex makes the small guys<lf>around it stronger, so it's super<lf>dangerous! This is really bad.
<string>We have to put everything<lf>we've got into this!
<string><VO:SER>Hinoa seems better. I'm so relieved!<lf>She's been so weird lately.
<string>Minoto brought Hinoa back in a<lf>flood of tears, and Hinoa's face<lf>was completely blue.
<string>Everyone was silent. It was awful.<lf>It can never happen again. Even<lf>thinking about it is awful.
<string><PL>!<lf>You have to take hunt down<lf>the monster that did this to Hinoa!
<string>I can tell Hinoa is back to her old self.<lf>She's been stuffing her face with<lf>dango all day!
<string>When Hinoa smiles, the whole village<lf>is a brighter place to be.
<string>But if that stupid blue monster<lf>comes back, I just know Hinoa<lf>will be in pain again...
<string>You have to find it and take it down!<lf>The Rampage is awful, but Hinoa<lf>being in any pain is even worse!
<string>What was the name of that monster?<lf>Ibuski...? Ibrushy? Stupid monster<lf>names!
<string>Really wish they'd think of better naming<lf>system. Something like, "Stupid Monster #1,"<lf>"Stupid Monster #2." See!? Easy!
<string>Anyway, when #1 roared, all the other monsters<lf>answered and attacked! That stupid monster<lf>was behind the Rampage all along!
<string><VO:SER>Grrrr! I hate that monster! If that stupid<lf>monster wasn't around, there'd be no<lf>stupid Rampage and Hinoa would OK!
<string><VO:NOR>I don't know where its butt is, but as<lf>soon as I find it, I'm gonna kick it!<lf>And I'll get the entire village to help!
<string>Finally that stupid Wind Serpent<lf>has shown its stupid face.
<string>For the village, and for Hinoa, there'll<lf>be no mercy! Right, <PL>?<lf>We're counting on you!
<string>Looks like that stupid monster got away.<lf>You don't think it'll come back, do you?
<string>Elder Fugen says we still have to worry<lf>about the Rampage so we can't let our<lf>guard down yet.
<string>At least we don't have to worry about<lf>Hinoa anymore. That's the only good<lf>thing to come out of this so far...
<string>Thank you so much <PL>!<lf>You really are the best! And so<lf>cool too! Teehehehe!
<string><VO:SER>After the Wind Serpent comes<lf>the Thunder Serpent, huh? Geez,<lf>what's next? "Slight Drizzle" Serpent?
<string>What was its name? Gnarly...?<lf>Nope. Narga? No that's some<lf>other stupid monster... Grrr!
<string>Give me a minute. It's right on<lf>the tip of my tongue! Shhhh!<lf>Don't tell me the answer!
<string><VO:NOR>Nawar—NARWA! It's Narwa!<lf>Thunder Serpent Narwa!<lf>OK, OK. I got it now!
<string>So, since you defeated Wind Serpent<lf>Ibushi, Thunder Serpent Narwa has<lf>shown up now?
<string>And, if we defeat Narwa, then there'll<lf>never be another Rampage, right!?<lf>......
<string><VO:SER>When we heard about what had<lf>happened with Minoto, the whole<lf>village panicked.
<string>For Hinoa to go through that was bad<lf>enough, but for BOTH of them to suffer<lf>like this—I feel so...helpless!
<string>Minoto seems OK though...<lf>Like, even better than normal.
<string>She acts like everything is fine. She even<lf>says she doesn't feel pain or anything.<lf>Maybe she's stronger than I thought.
<string>This is it, <PL>!
<string>I've already told you what I wanted<lf>to say. Anything else I wanted to<lf>say, the villagers said for me.
<string>But we're trying not to think about it.<lf>Instead, all of the village chefs are trying<lf>to come up with some new recipes!
<string>When you get home, we're going<lf>to have a huge feast! There'll be<lf>mountains of food!
<string>So, off you go! I need to start cooking!
<string>Don't keep us waiting! You have to<lf>take down that stupid monster before<lf>all the food gets cold! Good luck!
<string>It looks like the Rampage is finally<lf>subsiding now that Narwa and Ibushi<lf>have been defeated.
<string>The monsters are starting to realize<lf>the serpents are gone and are calming<lf>down. It should all be over soon.
<string>You saved Kamura Village!<lf>You're not just a real hunter,<lf>you're a real hero!
<string>But please don't stop there!<lf>Keep taking on quests and helping<lf>those in need of your skills!
<string>It's time: Time for your ultimate battle with<lf>Wind Serpent Ibushi and Thunder Serpent<lf>Narwa...! YES, I finally said it right! Go me!
<string>I knew I was gonna get it eventually.<lf>And now I have, I'll never forget how<lf>to do it—like riding a Wirebug, y'know?
<string>Totally same thing with you, <PL>.<lf>You already shooed Narwa and Ibushi away<lf>before, so this time'll be a cinch too!
<string>You just gotta give 'em the ol' one-two,<lf>and I bet you'll be back before dinner time!<lf>See you then, OK?
<string>Now you've put the spark back into Kamura,<lf>it's my time to shine and light up the whole<lf>village with my dango's deliciousness!
<string>Shiratama and Kinako are already laying<lf>the groundwork with some never-before-<lf>seen rice-pounding enthusiasm today.
<string>Come by anytime you need a pick-me-up,<lf>and we'll make you the most energizing<lf>meal you'll ever have!
<string>Bunny Dango are the culinary pride<lf>of Kamura. Their ingredients and<lf>their recipe are both one of a kind!
<string>Plus, they're full of nutrition! Just one<lf>order is enough to make you feel great!<lf>Just...don't eat too many!
<string>Although Hinoa eats more than<lf>50 orders a day and she seems OK...
<string>Kinako and Shiratama make<lf>marvelous rice cakes!
<string>Kinako is a seasoned professional,<lf>while Shiratama has just started his<lf>career.
<string>Shiratama has got a bright future ahead<lf>of him and has an excellent mentor, though<lf>she can be a little strict at times.
<string>But there's no hard feelings. They're<lf>really close and are always hanging<lf>out together or grabbing a bite to eat.
<string>Kagero the Merchant did all of<lf>the furnishing and interior design<lf>for the Tea Shop!
<string>He said us merchants have to<lf>stick together. He was so kind<lf>and gave me lots of tips.
<string>You might think he's mysterious...<lf>maybe even a little weird, but he's<lf>really a good person!
<string>I'm super-duper handy with<lf>a heavy bowgun. Surprised?<lf>Everyone else was too!
<string>I tried lots of different weapons when<lf>I was training to be a defender.<lf>It just felt so good in my hands!
<string>And it feels good when you shoot<lf>it too! Like letting off fireworks!<lf>BOOOOM!
<string>Don't you think Minoto is a bit too hard<lf>on herself? She's always putting herself<lf>down and comparing herself to Hinoa.
<string>I don't know why though! She's good<lf>at so many things! If you think my<lf>cooking's good, you should try hers!
<string>And have you seen what she can do<lf>with a lance? I've never seen anyone<lf>else come even close!
<string>She just brushes them off as duty and<lf>not talent. I wish she'd stop thinking<lf>she's the less-valuable sister.
<string>And that's a lesson for you too!<lf>Don't worry about what you can't<lf>do, focus on what you can!
<string>I'm always trying out new recipes,<lf>yet most of them are complete<lf>failures. Barely even edible!
<string>It used to really bum me out until<lf>Master Hojo told me that succeeding<lf>on the first try is not success, but luck.
<string>He said, accepting your mistakes and<lf>learning from them is the only way to<lf>achieve true success!
<string>Since then, I only try to concentrate<lf>on improving myself and appreciating<lf>what I have accomplished.
<string>New recipe time!
<string>Oh, <PL>!<lf>Hey, hey—could you hear<lf>me out for a sec?
<string>Since that run-in with Magnamalo,<lf>for some weird reason, I'm just<lf>overflowing with new ideas!
<string>I finally decided to just go with the flow,<lf>y'know? And guess what I came up with?<lf>..."Magnamalo Dango!"
<string>I had everyone try it, and<lf>the village was just full of<lf>lip-smacking and smiles!
<string>As soon as you dig in it's just gonna<lf>melt in your mouth, guar-an-teed!
<string>Hmmm... What should I do?
<string><PL>! We've got a major<lf>crisis here! Like, for REALsies!
<string>My ingredients supplier was attacked<lf>by an army of terrible, bloodthirsty<lf>monsters at the Shrine Ruins!
<string>...I mean, the merchant wasn't hurt or<lf>anything, but they ended up dropping the<lf>goods all over the place running away.
<string>Now they're super down,<lf>and feeling all guilty and<lf>stuff...
<string>Can you get back those ingredients<lf>for us? I'll find out where they are<lf>and mark it on your map!
<string>It'd cheer up the supplier for sure, and<lf>you'd get to try my brand new dango<lf>too! Pretty please with a cherry on top?
<string>Hmmm... What should I do?
<string><PL>? I had this super weird<lf>thing happen to me the other day...
<string>I went on a trip to buy dango<lf>ingredients, and it got dark<lf>before I could make it back.
<string>So, I was walking through some<lf>gloomy caverns alone, getting<lf>this reeeally creepy vibe...
<string>And suddenly, I heard these screams,<lf>like, "Gyaaaarh!" and, "Baggyaaar!"<lf>It really scared the life outta me!
<string>I panicked and ran home as quickly<lf>as I could, dropping all of my stuff<lf>on the way! *shudder*
<string>Please, can you go find my stuff for me?<lf>I know exactly where I left it, and I'll<lf>have dango ready when you're back!
<string>Hmmm... What should I do?
<string>Oh! <PL>!<lf>Hey, there's something I need<lf>your help with!
<string>So, I was thinking up a new Bunny<lf>Dango recipe the other day, when<lf>I ended up falling asleep.
<string>I felt guilty for slacking at first, but<lf>then I realized I was now full of<lf>energy—and that's when it hit me.
<string>You know that monster that makes you<lf>sleep, the Snore-can? Snooze-cat?<lf>Sock-a-manth—oh! <COLS RED>Somnacanth</COL>!
<string>Inspired by its majestic song, I could<lf>make dango that'll refresh my customers<lf>like a nice short powernap!
<string>Sooo...would you catch a Somnacanth for<lf>me? Please? I just know I could make<lf>some real awesome dango if you did!
<string>Hmmm... What should I do?
<string><PL>, perfect timing!<lf>I need ya to do me a favor!
<string>So, I asked my usual supplier<lf>to deliver some ingredients for<lf>my new Bunny Dango recipe.
<string>Except now, the trade route through<lf>the Frost Islands is swarming with all<lf>these stupid <COLS RED>Izuchi</COL> and <COL RED>Baggi</COL>!
<string>And I'm just...kinda worried, you know?<lf>Like, what if my trader gets pounced<lf>on by a bunch of dumb monsters!?
<string>Not to mention without ingredients,<lf>I won't be able to make the new menu,<lf>or the regular one, for that matter...
<string><PL>, is there any way you<lf>could, like, scout ahead, and shoo away<lf>those Izuchi and Baggi? Pleeease!?
<string>Hmmm... What should I do?
<string>Heya, <PL>! Have you tried<lf>Komitsu's new candy apples yet?
<string>Wait, never mind! I actually wanted to<lf>talk to you about something. It's top-secret<lf>though, so don't tell anyone, 'K?
<string>I want to add more deliciousness to my<lf>dango, so I'm thinking about making<lf>some with eggs from the Shrine Ruins.
<string>But juuust one problem...<lf>There are two <COLS RED>Kulu-Ya-Ku</COL> there,<lf>and they LOVE snatching eggs!
<string>Could you, uh, maybe do<lf>something about them while<lf>I make off with an egg or two?
<string>Please please please? It'll make<lf>the dango taste even better, so<lf>it'll totally be worth the trouble!
<string>Hmmm... What should I do?
<string>Oh, <PL>, <PL>!<lf>You'll never guess what happened!
<string>I went to the Flooded Forest to find<lf>some fish to make my Bunny Dango<lf>taste even better, but then...
<string>A stupid <COLS RED>Nargacuga</COL> came crashing<lf>through the forest, making a huge<lf>racket, and chased away all the fishies!
<string>So I went to a different spot to fish,<lf>but then a Chewra—uh, Juradoda— Um...
<string>Wait—I got it! <COLS RED>Jyuratodus</COL>! A big<lf>stupid Jyuratodus showed up and<lf>started flinging mud everywhere!
<string>The fishies were gone, I got covered<lf>in mud, didn't catch anything...<lf>It was literally the WORST! Ugh!
<string>Could you please do something about those<lf>dummies for me? Pleeease? And maybe<lf>throw in punch or kick for me too? Hehehe.
<string>Hmmm... What should I do?
<string>Oh, hey, <PL>!<lf>Check this out:
<string>"The all-new Bunny Dango:<lf>magma-toasted until crunchy!"
<string>Pretty snazzy right!? It's the new<lf>baking method I'm trying out to make<lf>my dango recipes even tastier!
<string>But then I heard that <COLS RED>Marshmallow</COL> and<lf>a <COL RED>Laughalos</COL> are having a stand-off in<lf>the Lava Caverns...
<string>I'd probably get burned to a crisp<lf>if I went there. Not to mention my<lf>poor Bunny Dango too...
<string>Could you please help me out? PLEASE!?<lf>Do it for the Bunny Dango!
<string>Hmmm... What should I do?
<string><PL>! Ooh,<lf>I am SO furious right now!<lf>Listen to this!
<string>I went to the Sandy Plains looking for<lf>herbs. I even packed a few dango<lf>for lunch and everything.
<string>So, yeah, I was there just searching around<lf>when— *BOOM* —TWO <COLS RED>Diablos</COL>,<lf>just burst outta nowhere!
<string>I ran out of there as fast as I could,<lf>but my dango fell, and got stuck on<lf>the horns of the Diablos behind me!
<string>I managed to get away, but I didn't<lf>get any of the herbs, and I lost<lf>my lunch too, and I just... Ugh.
<string>Please, <PL>, you gotta<lf>avenge my fallen lunch! I'll make some<lf>all-new herb dango for ya if you do!
<string>Hmmm... What should I do?
<string>Hmmm...<lf>No, that won't work either.<lf>Hmmmmmm...
<string>AHHH— Oh gosh! <PL>!<lf>You made me jump! I had no idea you were<lf>even there! What are you part Nargacuga!?
<string>I was thinking about how I could make<lf>a new kind of dango that's weird and<lf>unusual—in a good way. But I dunno...
<string>I mean, I have a vague idea:<lf>something thick with flavor<lf>and a little bit gooey...
<string>But breaking that idea down into<lf>specific ingredients for a recipe<lf>is where I start to get lost.
<string>So, <PL>!<lf>Know of anything thick and gooey<lf>that might work?
<string>Aw, thanks so much! I love you!
<string>Oh hey, <PL>.<lf>Got something for me?
<string>Wow! This IS thick! And gooey!<lf>And...slimy, actually.
<string>But OK. Um, let's see now.<lf>Huh, it just might—<lf>Oooh, this is...!
<string>Yeah, I got it!<lf>OK, I'm gonna make 'em in a flash,<lf>and put 'em up for sale right away!
<string>Thank you so much, <PL>!<lf>I love you! Hehehe!
<string>Hmmm... What should I do?
<string>Oh! Hey, <PL>!<lf>I wanted to ask for your help<lf>with something.
<string>So, the other day, I came up with a new<lf>Bunny Dango recipe, and this time<lf>I just know it's gonna turn out great!
<string>The problem is I need lots of Rhenoplos<lf>eggs for it. I mean, I tried to carry a few<lf>back here myself, except, well...
<string>It's way too much hard work!<lf>My entire body's yelling out in pain,<lf>and I just couldn't go on any longer!
<string>Please, <PL>!<lf>Think you could bring me a Rhenoplos egg<lf>when you're free?
<string>Aw, thanks so much! I love you!
<string>You're the best, <PL>!<lf>I got that egg you delivered!
<string>Everyone at the Tea Shop worked<lf>extra hard, 'cause we wanted to<lf>have something to show for your help.
<string>Aaaand...voila!<lf>The new menu is all ready! Yaaay!
<string>It's already live, and everyone's<lf>loving it! You should try it too<lf>when you get the chance!
<string>Hmmm... What should I do?
<string>Um, hey! Listen, there's this, uh...<lf>This thing I feel like I can only<lf>truly talk to you about...
<string>I wanna make some dango that're<lf>really healthy so everyone stays<lf>in tip-top shape!
<string>I've been reading some books with Otemai<lf>about "farm-a-suitacles." Like, what<lf>stuff is good for you and all that stuff.
<string>But hands-on experience is better,<lf>right? And for that, I need some stuff<lf>that MIGHT be a teensy bit hazardous.
<string>And no one does hazardous like you,<lf><PL>! Could you maybe...<lf>possibly...get me some?
<string>Aw, thanks so much! I love you!
<string>Thanks so, so much for the materials!<lf>I knew I asked the right person!
<string>This "farm-a-suitacle" stuff is so hard,<lf>even if someone reads it to me,<lf>my head still ends up spinning.
<string>But I'll keep at it so I can help<lf>everyone in the village stay healthy!
<string>Aaand, after a li'l studying, I tweaked<lf>the ingredients. The result came out<lf>so well, I had to put 'em on the menu!
<string>They're good for you AND they're tasty,<lf>so make sure you try some next time!
<string>Hmmm... What should I do?
<string>Hey, <PL>... You know I'm suuuper<lf>grateful that you always stop buy to order<lf>Bunny Dango, right?
<string>By the way, do you know what a <COLS RED>Quality Wyvern<lf>Egg</COL> is? So, they're this super expensive,<lf>hard-to-get ingredient, but...
<string>People say they're the yummiest, bestest<lf>eggs EVER! Imagine if I made Bunny Dango<lf>with them—They'd be the yummiest too!
<string>But it'd take so much time and effort<lf>to get one myself, not to mention<lf>the whole danger thing...
<string>But you don't mind a little danger,<lf>do you, <PL>!? You'll<lf>get one for me, won't you?
<string>Aw, thanks so much! I love you!
<string>Those Quality Wyvern Eggs<lf>you got for me made it to<lf>the Tea Shop safe and sound!
<string>I actually tried to go get some myself in the<lf>meantime, but they were so hard to carry,<lf>and there were so many monsters around...
<string>Now I see how tricky that really<lf>must've been. There's no way<lf>I could've done it without you!
<string>But it was worth the trouble: we took those<lf>eggs and made a brand new, cutting-edge,<lf>delectability-guaranteed Bunny Dango!
<string>You're gonna love it, I promise!
<string>Oh! <PL>!
<string>Hey, <PL>, thanks for always<lf>ordering the Motley Mix! It's opened my<lf>eyes to so many new ingredients.
<string>Just be careful—you can't fill up on<lf>only meat and fish and leave no room<lf>for your dango, ya know!
<string>That's why, to thank you for your custom,<lf>here's a ticket for a special dango!<lf>Don't forget to eat your Bunny Dango!
<string>It's my best yet! You're gonna love it!
