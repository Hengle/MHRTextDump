<string>"Yo-ho-hoooo, Hunter!~♪"
<string>"Yo-ho-hooo~♪ Yo-ho-hooo~♪"<lf>Ahoy, Hunter! How you doin' today? Good!<lf>I was wondering if you had a sec!
<string>Day in and day out, it's the same thing, aye?<lf>Crates of cargo and that sourpuss, Tanko.<lf>I've never been so sick of a routine...
<string>Which got me thinking! How 'bouts we break<lf>up this monotony with a little quest, aye?<lf>Something spicy or sweet. How 'bouts both?
<string>What's that? Hahaha! Oh, it's not for me,<lf>ya goof! The quest is for YOU! I just wanna<lf>hear about it when ya get back! "Yo-ho~♪"
<string>"Yo-ho-hoooo, Hunter!~♪"
<string>"Yo-ho-hooo~♪ Ahoy, Hunter!<lf>Yours truly just had the best idea and<lf>I was wondering if you'd lend me a hand.
<string>This Outpost is nice and all, but there's<lf>not much to do, ya know? So I was thinking...<lf>How 'bout we open up a monster circus!?
<string>We dress up a monster in a goofy outfit<lf>and make it do some tricks while I sing<lf>some of my best hits. Sounds fun, right?
<string>We're already halfway there. All we need now<lf>is a monster! A Blood Orange Bishaten would<lf>be perfect! They can even breathe fire!
<string>"Yo-ho-hoooo, thanks!~♪"
<string>Heeeeeey! And a fine specimen to boot, aye?<lf>Just what the circus ordered! Me and the<lf>monkey, in it to the end!
<string>Now for your reward, I talked to the pretty<lf>redhead over at the Smithy about upgradin'<lf>one of your hunting horns! Go check it out!
<string>Now, if you'll excuse me, I got a whole<lf>lotta nothing to get back to! Hahaha!<lf>"Yo-ho-hooo~♪ Yo-ho-hooo~♪"
<string>Ahoy, Hunter! How are ya? Good! Me?<lf>Couldn't be better! I'm just checking all<lf>these new deliveries that came in.
<string>Cargo from just about anywhere you can<lf>think of flows through here. Keeps me<lf>mighty busy. Busier than I'd like to be!
<string>Hey, would ya like a little souvenir?<lf>Here take this!
<string>Oi, you're that new hunter they brought<lf>in, aye? Name's Pingarh, pleased to<lf>meet ya!
<string>This ugly mug behind me is Tanko.<lf>Come and say hello, why don't ya?
<string>...Aye, again with the silent treatment.<lf>He's at that age, y'know? Pay him no<lf>mind, you'd be doing me a favor.
<string>"Yo-ho-hooo~♪ Yo-ho-hoooooooo~♪"<lf>Quite a sweet breeze we got comin'<lf>off the waves today, aye Hunter?
<string>On days like this, when the waters<lf>behave themselves, a guy can't help<lf>but be in a good mood.
<string>Headin' off somewhere, Hunter? If you're<lf>up for an excursion, I'd be happy to tag<lf>along! Whattaya say?
<string>What, me? Tryin' to skip work? Ha!<lf>Good one, pal! "Yo-ho-hoo~♪"
<string>Ahoy, Hunter! Came all this way to see<lf>your ol' pal Pingarh, didja?
<string>Harhar, just pullin' your leg. Hey, no<lf>one asked your sourpuss their opinion,<lf>Tanko!
<string>An investigation, ya say? Sounds rough.<lf>Hate to say it, but I don't think I'd be<lf>much help out there.
<string>But, good luck to ya out there, Hunter!<lf>We're rootin' for ya, from stem to stern!<lf>"Yo-ho-hooo~♪"
<string>The huntin' life is tough, but bein'<lf>a sailor ain't exactly an ocean cruise,<lf>if you know what I mean.
<string>Liftin' all this cargo is the worst, but if ya<lf>know a good shanty, it helps lighten the<lf>load. Sing along, now! "Yo-ho-hooo~♪"
<string>Right, this looks like a good place<lf>to stop for the day. Say Hunter, you<lf>headin' out on an investigation?
<string>Pity, a real pity, I tell ya. Yours truly<lf>is done for the day! Have a good one!<lf>"Work is done! Yo-ho-ho-hooooo~♪"
<string>"Yo-ho-hooo~♪ An' a koo-koo-kooo~♪<lf>Have ya heard the tale of the Snowy Cohoot?~♪"
<string>"On moonlit nights an' clear blue days~♪<lf>Its porcelain wings sheen a way's away~♪"
<string>"Those saucer eyes shinin' and that<lf>teeny-weeny beak~♪ One hoo hoo hoo'll<lf>keep ya giddy fer a week~♪"
<string>"Aye what a beaut, an' a good omen too~♪<lf>Now ye heard the tale of the Snowy Cohoooot~♪"
<string>Bein' a hunter ain't easy, that's for sure.<lf>Havin' to look after others is just the tip<lf>of the iceberg.
<string>I can relate. Tryin' to keep ol' sourpuss over<lf>there in high spirits is a job all by itself.<lf>C'mon, Tanko! Sing with me! "Yo-ho-hooo~♪"
<string>Each time I hear about some new monster<lf>I'm just reminded how lucky I am to be<lf>a sailor. Unless it's an ocean monster...
<string>Well, you keep at it, Hunter. Me? I've got<lf>work not to do. Hahaha! C'mon, Tanko.<lf>With your gut this time! "Yo-ho-hooo~♪"
<string>You hunters gotta learn to slow down;<lf>always zippin' around here and there.<lf>It's good to be active, sure, but...
<string>Takin' a day off every once in a while<lf>ain't so bad. Stop and smell the Flowferns,<lf>y'know?
<string>A bit of breathing room'll give ya some<lf>perspective on your work. And speakin'<lf>of, it's about that time! Ha! "Yo-ho-hooo~♪"
<string>"Yo-ho-hooo—" Well, would you look at<lf>that! It's quittin' time—right on schedule!
<string>Wanna know my secret? Tell your boss<lf>the task'll take longer on purpose!
<string>That way you can work leisurely—uhh,<lf>I mean carefully—and if you finish early,<lf>ya get praised! You can't lose!
<string>An urgent quest, aye? Sounds pretty intense.
<string>Hmm, in that case... How's about I go on<lf>an "urgent rest," then? No? Ahhh, you're<lf>no fun...
<string>Something's changed with the research<lf>team, wouldn't you say? Still, can't say<lf>I hate the tension in the air.
<string>I mean, it's got practically nothing to<lf>do with me. I haven't had such an easy<lf>time as this, maybe ever!
<string>Oh, uh, I'll do my job, of course.<lf>Flawlessly! ...I mean, if I have to.<lf>"Yo-ho-hoo~♪ Yo-ho-hooo~♪"
<string>Yours truly don't know monster poison<lf>from a pint of grog, but maybe I'll give<lf>a shout to the off-duty ship doctor.
<string>Better than all of us having our hands<lf>too full if things take a turn for the worse!<lf>Best we don't need him, though.
<string>The mood around here's lightened<lf>up a little bit, aye?
<string>Everyone's clinging to the glimmer of<lf>hope from that medicine getting made.<lf>That's the way we do things in Elgado!
<string>Well ain't it the way? I'm glad to see<lf>everyone get pep back in their step, but<lf>now I'm up to my elbows in work, here!
<string>A fella don't even got time to spare for<lf>a lackadaisical tune! Yooo~♪ Yo-ho—<lf>what, that? Just tuning up the ol' pipes.
<string>Well, you love to see it! Great job out<lf>there, really, pal. Why not take a step<lf>back from the work—take it easy?
<string>No one will complain if the brilliant<lf>Hunter that bested ol' Malzeno wants<lf>to take a break for once.
<string>Why not take a page out of my book?<lf>Repeat after me: "Yooooo~♪ Hoooo~♪"<lf>Well? Feels good, don't it?
<string>Finally figured out why Tanko's been<lf>acting so weird. It was for my sake...<lf>Some gossip he'd heard around the port.
<string>Something about me getting stuck in<lf>this field work gig 'cause of some goof<lf>I'd made.
<string>Talk about a mix-up! Who'd wanna get<lf>stuck in the capital doing paperwork,<lf>day in, day out? Thanks, but no thanks.
<string>I'd rather let my jolly tunes ride the salt<lf>wind out into these waters. You can<lf>count me out of that royal rat race.
<string>Hopping from port to port like this is what<lf>being a sailor's all about, right? I suspect<lf>you can empathize, my friend.
<string>Ahoy! I figure the best thing I can do<lf>for folks doing the heavy lifting is to<lf>lift their spirits up in turn, see? *ahem*
<string>"Malzeno~♪ Where'd he go?~♪ Now we're<lf>stuck with the Qurio~♪" Heh. Good, right?<lf>How 'bouts an encore earful?
<string>Aye, but always leave 'em wantin' more,<lf>they say. That just means you'll have to<lf>make another trip back here, won't ya?
<string>Ahoy, Hunter! Couldn't have come at<lf>a better time! We just finished whipping<lf>that massive ship into shipshape.
<string>Everyone in Elgado lent a hand, from<lf>the sailors to the not sailors! Yours<lf>truly lent TWO hands, of course!
<string>You best not let all this Pingarh-brand<lf>elbow grease go to waste! Do what ya<lf>gotta do, and make it back in one piece.
<string>Oh, I know! I'll write a little ditty about you!<lf>It'll be a hit, I can feel it in my bones. "There<lf>once was a hunter from a faraway land~♪"
<string>Things are starting to slow down, aye?<lf>I should be back to my old routine in<lf>no time!
<string>Working together to overcome the crisis<lf>plaguing the Kingdom was a heckuva job.<lf>Couldn't have done it without you!
<string>Leisurely labor on the docks is the life<lf>that suits me best. Even if ol' sourpuss<lf>Tanko's got a few gripes about it.
<string>I've taken a shining to this ol' Outpost.<lf>Nice and calm around here these days.
<string>But if they're mobilizing hunters like you...<lf>More like a calm before the storm, aye?<lf>Best batten down the hatches.
<string>When the wind hits me like this...<lf>The songs just pour on out of me.
<string>The waves, the briny breeze—they play<lf>ol' Pingarh like a big ole flute, reaching<lf>out to the fine folks of Elgado.
<string>How's a guy supposed to do a job with<lf>his true calling staring him in the face,<lf>you feel me? "Yoooo-ho-hooo~♪"
<string>"Wouldn't it be keen? A sailor's delight~♪<lf>To meet in a dream on a lonesome night?~♪"
<string>"Fret not, my pet~♪ Sigh not, my dear~♪<lf>For me whispers will reach your faraway<lf>ears~♪"
<string>"And the moon will shine~♪ On the deck<lf>we'll dance~♪ For love in a dream is a<lf>sailor's romance~♪"
<string>That ol' sourpuss, Tanko... He's been<lf>giving me the cold shoulder lately.<lf>Well, an EVEN colder one than usual.
<string>How can a guy have such an icy stare<lf>with such gentle waves in his sightline,<lf>and a pleasant breeze at his back?
<string>If you've got something to say, just come<lf>out and say it already!
<string>"With a mew, and a meow, and a yo-ho-<lf>hooo~♪ There goes the Spelunker, with<lf>dreams in tow~♪
<string>"Visions of gold ore~♪ A mountain of<lf>treasure~♪ A reward for true hearts,<lf>and heroic endeavors~♪"
<string>Heh, what do you think? Gotta give<lf>a shout out to the Felynes working<lf>their tails off aboard that thing!
<string>"Hail to the brave~♪ Hail to bravado~♪<lf>Hail to the Hunter, hero of Elgado~♪"
<string>"May tales of their deeds and their<lf>derring-do~♪ Cross the hills, and<lf>the seas, and the valleys t'you~♪"
<string>"Raise a glass to <PL>~♪<lf>Sing songs of praise~♪ May that name echo<lf>in our hearts for the rest of our days~♪"
<string>"Lovers of the sea~♪<lf>Aye, we know no fear~♪<lf>The rudder of fate is ours to steer~♪"
<string>"Storms we'll weather~♪<lf>Across the seas together~♪<lf>Fearless in pursuit of rip-roaring adventure~♪"
<string>"We conquer the waves with sail and rope~♪<lf>Guided by compass ye folks calls hope~♪"
<string>"With the wind at their backs, and the<lf>morning tide rising~♪ The Kingdom's<lf>proud sailors seek further horizons~♪"
