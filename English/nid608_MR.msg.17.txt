<string>Fur-esh dango!
<string><NOFAC>Sweet beans! It's the hunter fur-om Kamura!
<string>I'm Azuki, owner and o-purr-ator of the Tea<lf>Shop here in Elgado! Welcome!
<string>You must be exhausted after such a long<lf>journey! And hungry, too!
<string>At least, I hope you're hungry because<lf>we just added a sweet mew feature to<lf>the Tea Shop! <COLS RED>Hopping Skewers</COL>!
<string>These mew skewers will level up your<lf>dango experience—or level down...<lf>Er, more about that later. *ahem*
<string>Either way, you can enjoy this brand mew<lf>feature at no extra cost! I can't wait for<lf>you to try it out!
<string>Be a sweet bean and lend me a paw?
<string>Meowdy, Hunter! I was wondering if you<lf>could lend me a paw.
<string>See, I came up with a new dango recipe<lf>to help meow-t all the researchers and<lf>hunters out in the field, but...
<string>The ingredients I need grow in Daimyo<lf>Hermitaur territory, so I'm having a tough<lf>time purr-ocuring them...
<string>At this rate I'll never get this new dango<lf>added to the menu...
<string>Do you think you could eighty-six those<lf>Daimyo Hermitaur so I can harvest those<lf>ingredients in peace?
<string>Be a sweet bean and lend me a paw?
<string>Meowdy, Hunter. Sorry to bother you<lf>while you're busy, but I could really<lf>use your help again.
<string>Everyone's been working their paws to the<lf>bone, so I thought I'd make a new dango<lf>to put some pep in their step.
<string>I did a little research and found a recipe<lf>that uses sap from pinecones. The only<lf>problem is...
<string>Those paw-ticular pinecones are ones that<lf>Blood Orange Bishaten hoard, and they're<lf>meowty territorial about 'em!
<string>You think you can get those monkeys<lf>to split while I go grab the goods?
<string>Be a sweet bean and lend me a paw?
<string>Sweet beans, I'm glad you came, Hunter!<lf>I'm in a bit of a jam and I was wondering<lf>if you could help meow-t.
<string>See, I came up with a new dango recipe<lf>that helps you conserve sta-mew-na, and<lf>ordered some ingredients, but...
<string>The suppliers were attacked by meownsters<lf>in the Fur-ost Islands! Luckily, they escaped,<lf>but they won't last long without your help!
<string>Right meow they're hiding in a cave, but<lf>I'm worried they might get mushed into<lf>paste if we don't act fast!
<string>Is it paw-ssible for you to go and get<lf>rid of those meownsters? You're the<lf>only one I can count on!
<string>Be a sweet bean and lend me a paw?
<string>Well, I'll be smushed and spread! I can't<lf>thank you enough for all of your hard work.<lf>The Tea Shop is thriving thanks to you!
<string>By the way, I've thought up a sweet<lf>mew dango recipe with a spicy kick!<lf>Interested?
<string>Eating one makes you mew-ve with<lf>elegance and fury. I'm sure it'll come<lf>in handy traversing through quests.
<string>The graceful mew-vements of the Mizutsune<lf>and the fur-ious power of the Astalos should<lf>act as reference to complete this.
<string>I know you're busy but helping meow-t<lf>with dango R&D will only serve to benefit<lf>you in the future!
<string>Be a sweet bean and lend me a paw?
<string>Oh, it's you, Hunter. The truth is, I'm<lf>having trouble with a new dango recipe.<lf>Purr-haps you could help meow-t?
<string>Did you know that there's a Bunny Dango<lf>that transforms the bonds with your<lf>Buddies into power?
<string>This is a traditional recipe that's been<lf>passed down from Felyne to Felyne, and<lf>I thought I'd like to make them myself.
<string>The only purr-oblem is that the materials<lf>can only be found deep in the highlands<lf>of the Citadel...
<string>And the highlands are filled with fur-<lf>ightening meownsters! Can you go clear<lf>'em meow-t so I can gather the ingredients?
<string>Be a sweet bean and lend me a paw?
<string>Meowdy, Hunter! You sure are busy lately,<lf>so I've thought up the purr-fect mew dango<lf>to help you out!
<string>As you go on more challenging quests,<lf>you're gonna need food that purr-ovides<lf>a boost of lasting sta-mew-na!
<string>I've been working to purr-fect the concept,<lf>but there's still something missing. I can't<lf>quite put my paw on it...
<string>Purr-haps if I watch you while you hunt,<lf>the experience can purr-ovide that spark<lf>of culinary ins-purr-ation!
<string>You'll have to fight multiple meownsters<lf>to purr-ovide me the scenes my creativity<lf>craves. I hope you can help meow-t!
<string>Do you have a moment?
<string>Meowdy, Hunter! I was wondering if you<lf>could lend me a paw. I'm purr-paring a<lf>moon-viewing party, and I had an idea!
<string>What if I were to invite some bunny<lf>fur-iends to the party? Bunny fur-iends<lf>and Bunny Dango! Nice combo, right?
<string>See, legend has it that bunnies pound<lf>mochi on the moon, so it would fit the<lf>theme quite nicely, I think.
<string>The only purr-oblem is I don't know any<lf>bunnies purrs-onally... Do you think<lf>you could round up some fur me?
<string>Thank you so much!
<string>Sweet beans! I wasn't expecting<lf>a Lagombi, still... It fits the bill if<lf>I'm looking for a leporine guest.
<string>This is gonna be one hare-raising affair!<lf>And my pre-purr-ations are purr-ogressing<lf>smoothly too!
<string>As thanks, I'll teach you how to upgrade<lf>a weapon very dear to the Tea Shop! Go<lf>see the Smithy for more details!
<string>Meowdy, Hunter. How do you like<lf>the Bunny Dango here in Elgado?
<string>I try to match the taste of Kamura dango<lf>as closely as possible, but...
<string>Because of the difference in climate and<lf>environment, I did have to alter the way<lf>it's purr-epared a little...
<string>Meowdy, Hunter! A-Are you leaving us<lf>already?
<string>...Oh, it's not a quest? You're heading<lf>to Kamura, are you? How exhausting<lf>that must be!
<string>Please send regards to Yomogi and<lf>everyone at the Tea Shop! I look forward<lf>to serving you when you return!
<string>Welcome back, Hunter. How was your<lf>trip back to Kamura?
<string>Did you visit Yomogi and the others at<lf>the Tea shop during your stay? How<lf>are they doing?
<string>...Hehe, well, it's lovely to hear that they're<lf>keeping busy. Sweet beans! I gotta stop<lf>gossiping and get back to work!
<string>Everyone works in shifts from morning<lf>until night. Don't want Elgado's workforce<lf>spread too thin, mew know?
<string>So, to keep everyone fed, the Tea Shop<lf>stays open twenty four hours a day,<lf>seven days a week! Even holidays!
<string>But in order to do that, there's three<lf>essential ingredients: sleep, food, and<lf>rest. Essential for you hunters, too!
<string>Meowdy, Hunter! Are you heading meow-t<lf>on a quest?
<string>In that case, let me know what you'd<lf>like, and I'll send you on your way<lf>with a bellyful of my finest dango.
<string>It's taken a lot of hard work, but it's ever<lf>so rewarding to purr-oduce dango here<lf>in Elgado that rival those fur-om Kamura!
<string>I'm so glad that everyone here loves<lf>my dango and just can't get enough<lf>of them.
<string>Of course, no one loves them as much<lf>as Hinoa! That girl is a bottomless pit!
<string>Meowdy, Hunter. I hear your next hunt<lf>is gonna be pawfully difficult.
<string>Well, it's important to keep your head!<lf>Remember: The calmer you are, the better<lf>you can concentrate!
<string>It's the same with creating new dango<lf>flavors. No sense getting hot and<lf>bothered. You can't rush ins-purr-ation!
<string>Meowdy, Hunter! I don't believe I've asked<lf>what your favorite flavor is yet.
<string>I like to ask my regulars their<lf>purr-eferences. It gives me ideas for new<lf>flavors to work on.
<string>I hope you know I appurr-reciate your<lf>patronage. I want nothing more than<lf>for my customers to be satisfied.
<string>The Qurio...was it? Not the most<lf>attractive creatures, I must say.
<string>But I wonder if they could inspire a new<lf>dango creation...? Let's see. Purr-haps<lf>this shape...that flavor...this scent...
<string>Hm... No, it's too hard. I just can't think<lf>of a way to turn the idea into a worthy<lf>dango.
<string>Meowdy, Hunter. So the meownster everyone<lf>in Elgado's been chasing has finally been<lf>found!
<string>While that's wonderful news, I heard Lady<lf>Fiorayne has been injured?
<string>It may have been just a scratch, but<lf>a wound is still a wound! I'll make sure<lf>she gets more dango than she can eat!
<string><VO:SER>I'm so worried about Lady Fiorayne.<lf>It was supposed to be a minor wound,<lf>but now she's succumbed to poison...
<string>If there's anything at all I could do to<lf>help, I'd be more than happy to oblige.
<string>I'll start by cooking some nice, soft<lf>dango with a runny filling that she can<lf>eat even when her appetite's gone.
<string>Do you think it'll be paw-ssible to make<lf>the medicine that Lady Fiorayne needs?<lf>...Oh, good. That's a relief.
<string>B-But poison...in a medicine? ...Yes,<lf>that's one way, I suppose. Poison is<lf>mysterious stuff indeed.
<string>Purr-haps poison should feature in my next<lf>dango recipe— I'm kidding! I'm kidding!<lf>That wouldn't be a good idea at all.
<string>So after a long purr-suit, it's finally time to<lf>face Meowzeno...
<string>Ever since Elgado was established, I've<lf>heard stories of how that meownster has<lf>terrorized the Kingdom.
<string>So I'm gonna cook up an extra su-purr<lf>special batch of dango in support and<lf>wish you the very best of luck!
<string>With Meowzeno defeated, I thought our<lf>troubles were over, but I guess I was<lf>wrong...
<string>Still, it doesn't change the fact that a<lf>great enemy of the kingdom has been<lf>laid to rest. Dango on the house today!
<string>Wait, wait, wait! I can't do that! But what<lf>I can do, though, is purr-epare the most<lf>delicious dango ever! ...Or at least try!
<string>Oh, you look stressed, Hunter. Anything<lf>I can do to help you meow-t?
<string>I don't purr-etend to know what troubles<lf>you're facing, but would a delicious<lf>dango or two ease your woes?
<string>You can't purr-form well on an empty<lf>stomach. Let me offer you a few of my<lf>finest treats!
<string>What's going on, Hunter? The skies have<lf>gotten dark all of a sudden...
<string>But I won't let it get me down! It's my<lf>mission to serve Elgado with good<lf>cheer and good food!
<string>No matter how dark things get, my<lf>delicious dango will always brighten<lf>your day!
<string>Sweet beans! There are all sorts of rumors<lf>flying around saying that you're going to<lf>face a fairy-tale demon!
<string>I'm sure you can handle it, but I can't<lf>help but to worry about you...
<string>I'll be purr-paring dozens of batches of<lf>dango while you're away, so make sure<lf>you come back hungry!
<string>Meowdy, Hunter! I'm so glad to have you<lf>as one of my regulars!
<string>Mew know, people all over the Kingdom<lf>are gonna be lining up to try our dango<lf>thanks to you!
<string>Sweet beans! I can see it meow! A Tea<lf>Shop furr-anchise on every corner! But<lf>I think I'll stay in Elgado a bit longer...
<string>I can't leave my best customer just yet!<lf>So, what'll it be today?
<string>Mew know, I'm actually fur-om Kamura,<lf>too. And before I came to Elgado, I used<lf>to work at the Tea Shop in Kamura.
<string>But because Bunny Dango are so popular<lf>I decided to expand the business! We're<lf>going global, baby! Hehehe.
<string>But furst, I need make sure the Tea Shop<lf>here is a success before I mew-ve on.<lf>I look forward to serving you!
<string>Cooking dango to purr-fection is really<lf>quite tricky, mew know.
<string>The hardest part is that everyone likes<lf>them cooked differently. Some like them<lf>lightly cooked, others, well browned.
<string>But it gives me great purr-leasure getting<lf>each dango I purr-vey just right for each<lf>customer.
<string>This location is actually very convenient<lf>for me, mew know.
<string>There's lots of paw traffic and I have an<lf>excellent view. I can learn a great deal<lf>about my customers' mew-ds.
<string>Which means when they pay me a visit,<lf>I can offer them the purr-fect treat to<lf>suit the day they're having. Clever, no?
<string>Hahaha, Chichae looks chip-purr as ever<lf>today. Look at her nodding greetings to<lf>everyone. Isn't she adorable?
<string>She reminds me of Yomogi, mew know...
<string>They're both such hard workers and so<lf>paw-sitive. They're a joy to behold!<lf>...Meow then, back to work.
<string>Your housekeeper has started to visit<lf>me quite regularly, mew know.
<string>Apparently, he's not such a great cook,<lf>but wants to impurr-ove to serve you better.
<string>That's meowty lucky of you to have someone<lf>who cares about you that much. I hope you<lf>get a chance to sample his effur-ts!
<string>I mentioned to your housekeeper that<lf>I was thinking of leaving Elgado to sell<lf>dango elsewhere the other day.
<string>And he looked pawfully upset... And<lf>then it hit me. I didn't even notice!<lf>He's completely...and utterly...
<string>Head-over-paws in love with dango!
<string>That's why he's been coming here so<lf>often. I really must teach him how to<lf>make dango next time.
<string>Mew Bunny Dango available!
<string>Purr-fect timing, Hunter! Why just this<lf>morning, I cooked up a new batch of<lf>Bunny Dango.
<string>I call them the Elgado Special! Bunny<lf>Dango made to embody the beautiful<lf>scenery we all meow and love here.
<string>The blueish dough evokes the clear<lf>oceans. Kneading a little salt in<lf>adds a refreshing aftertaste.
<string>A little brown sugar syrup on top, and<lf>you're in heaven! Relish this daily<lf>special whenever it's in stock.
<string>Mew Bunny Dango available!
<string>Meowdy, Hunter. I have some Bunny<lf>Dango you simply must try! They're<lf>called "Easy-Breezy Dango."
<string>Whenever you perform a Switch Skill<lf>Swap, you'll recover a little health!
<string>I hope dango can take you to even<lf>greater heights, even after defeating<lf>the Archdemon of the Abyss.
<string>The real treat is in the texture. It melts<lf>in your meow-th in a most unusual way.<lf>You really should try it!
<string>Thank you so much!
<string>Meowdy, Hunter! Thank you for all your<lf>Motley Mix orders!
<string>Purr-paring all the crazy ingredients<lf>you bring me gets my own culinary<lf>juices fired up!
<string>As a special thank you, here are some<lf>tickets to order my very best dango.<lf>Please keep on eating Bunny Dango!
