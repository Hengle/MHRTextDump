<string>Welcome, welcome!<lf><PL>, I purrsume?<lf>You're the talk of Elgado.
<string>Meow me to introduce myself. I'm Bis.<lf>And behind me is my partner, Cotta.
<string>Don't worry, we're well up to scratch<lf>when it comes to smithin'. We won't be<lf>outdone by the Smithy from your village!
<string>So, what are you lookin' fur?<lf>I'm all ears!
<string>Go ahead! Purruse the shop and see<lf>all the pawsome gear we make.<lf>Try things out, if ya want.
<string>When you're not sure what you want,<lf>that's when you stumble on somethin'<lf>great. Take it from someone who knows!
<string>Have you noticed, <PL>?<lf>Cotta and me have matchin' work clothes!<lf>Nice kit, huh?
<string>The colors and design are based off<lf>Minayle's. But we made some tweaks so<lf>it looked more fittin' fur workshop attire.
<string>We look purretty neat, huh? ...And cute?<lf>Meow you're talkin'! Haha, I like ya!
<string>Hey, <PL>!<lf>I've got some great suggestions of gear<lf>fur your Buddies!
<string>Maybe they could have a little try-on<lf>later? C'mon, don't be shy!
<string>Aw, too busy? Not a good time, huh?<lf>Well, see ya later, then. We'll be<lf>waitin' for your next visit!
<string>Since we make a living from forgin',<lf>obviously we want purrlenty of orders<lf>from customers for new kit.
<string>But on the other paw, as craftscats,<lf>we want our customers to like what<lf>they buy and use it for years to come.
<string>There's no right answer!<lf>But as I always say, you can't go far<lf>wrong if you make everythin' with style!
<string>As a Buddy Smithy, I don't make regular kit.<lf>I'm all about style!
<string>I mean, ya dice with death to get the<lf>materials, and then use 'em fur makin'<lf>gear to hunt more deadly meownsters...
<string>Style doesn't get more stimulatin' than<lf>that! Or purractical! Once you know<lf>the feelin', ya never look back!
<string>So, there's a mysterious creature out<lf>there that could be drivin' meownsters<lf>nuts, huh? Hm...
<string>...Sorry, started daydreamin' there.<lf>I mean, imagine the kind o' scrap<lf>you could get from that thing.
<string>We got to see that Qurio thing.<lf>My whiskers was it u-uh-gly!
<string>I hope no one wants me to forge<lf>anything with it!
<string>I mean, it's too small to purr-oduce any<lf>good scrap, and I'm sure you'll agree...<lf>it's like the oppurrsite of stylish!
<string>If you ask me, there's a kind of<lf>regional fashion to Buddy Equipment.
<string>Like, the kind of gear that's paw-pular<lf>here in Elgado isn't the same as<lf>what's paw-pular in the capital.
<string>I mean, I know you encounter different<lf>meownsters there, but I don't think that's<lf>the only reason. It's fashion.
<string><VO:SER>So, bad mews, huh? I'm worried about<lf>Lady Fiorayne...
<string>We want to help any way we can.<lf>I mean, we want to see her back<lf>on her paws—feet again.
<string>I guess doctors need materials fur<lf>medicines just like we need 'em fur<lf>forgin'...
<string>And the kind of powerful materials<lf>needed fur that juice aren't gonna<lf>be easy to come by, right?
<string>Good luck, <PL>.<lf>Me and Cotta will be rootin' fur ya!
<string>Keep up the good work, <PL>.<lf>The whole of Elgado needs to pull<lf>together now to help Lady Fiorayne.
<string>So...how about somethin' stylish to<lf>put you in a good mewd?
<string>Like, say, a new piece of Buddy<lf>Equipment, huh?
<string>What!? We haven't even seen scrap<lf>from Malzeno!
<string>Too bad it's so dangerous fur you,<lf>but just the idea of that thing gets<lf>my creative juices flowin'!
<string>Wow, <PL>! You're a cat<lf>above the rest! How about I forge you<lf>some new equipment to celebrate?
<string>Wearing newer, stronger gear is not<lf>about luxury, it's about investin' in<lf>your future!
<string>This is purrcisely the time a hunter<lf>and their Buddies should take it<lf>to the next level!
<string>So, there could be a new host, huh?<lf>Which means...there could be new scrap!
<string>I figured Malzeno's defeat would mean<lf>things calmin' down, but I'm more fired<lf>up than ever!
<string>Lookin' furward to seein' what your<lf>investigations turn up, <PL>!
<string>Ya know, befur I became a Smithy,<lf>I didn't like my color and markings.
<string>It was learnin' about style here on the<lf>job that helped me appreciate my<lf>purrsonal qualities.
<string>I'm grateful fur that. And now I wanna<lf>pass that gratitude on.
<string>So whatever ya need, just say the word!<lf>Fur a Buddy of yours, <PL>,<lf>we'll pull out all the stops!
<string>As long as the research into the Qurio<lf>continues, it looks like we're gonna<lf>be purretty busy round here.
<string>But as you're litter-ally one of our<lf>greatest customers, <PL>,<lf>that's just fine!
<string>See, Cotta's lookin' purrleased, too.<lf>...Huh? You think he looks the same<lf>as ever?
<string>Well then, you better keep comin' back<lf>to our Smithy until you can read his<lf>expressions better!
<string>Hey, <PL>,<lf>are you only choosin' your Buddy<lf>Equipment based on how purractical it is?
<string>I mean, that's totally fine, but sometimes<lf>it's neat to think about style and try to<lf>pick matchin' stuff.
<string>I mean, everyone loves lookin' good,<lf>right? Well, Buddies are no different!
<string>With all her travelin' and time in<lf>Kamura, Minayle's learned so<lf>much about forgin'.
<string>We were both awfully envious, so we<lf>got her to show us some tricks.
<string>And that's how we can make the same<lf>Buddy Equipment here as you can get<lf>over in Kamura.
<string>Cotta's kinda quiet compared to me, huh?<lf>Got different skills and purreferences,<lf>too. But that's ideal!
<string>Means we can split the load and take<lf>each other's jobs if we don't like 'em.
<string>We've got different food purreferences<lf>as well, so we never have to hiss at<lf>each other over a meal.
<string>Ya know, Minayle next door doesn't<lf>just have pawsome forgin' knowledge<lf>and skill...
<string>She also leaves the purrfect parts fur<lf>us as great scrap so we can make<lf>our buddy equipment more easily.
<string>Doin' that while managin' her own<lf>forgin' work so flawlessly... She is<lf>one cool cat!
<string>Most armor fur hunters is made to<lf>measure.
<string>But the gear we make here isn't like<lf>that. It's gotta fit a whole range of<lf>different Buddies.
<string>So we've gotta have the skills to make<lf>stuff any buddy can slink about in<lf>comfortably. And that's not easy.
<string>Thanks to you, <PL>,<lf>we've been able to make a meowntain<lf>of new Buddy Equipment here in Elgado.
<string>With everythin' I've learned, I'm thinkin'<lf>of bringin' out a new line in Elgado<lf>fashion gear!
<string>Like maybe... Yeah, a legendary Kingdom<lf>design incor-purr-atin' original Kamura<lf>elements...
<string>Stroke of genius, huh? I've gotta get<lf>drawin' designs with my trusty partner<lf>whenever we've got some down time!
