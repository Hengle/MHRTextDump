<string>Hey, <PL>.<lf>Welcome to the Gathering Hub.
<string>Just in case you didn't know, if you're<lf>looking to accept Hub quests, talk to Miss<lf>Minoto over there and she'll set you up.
<string>Hope you brought some friends because,<lf>generally speaking, Hub quests are for<lf>a full party of hunters.
<string>Of course, if you're some kind of super-<lf>hunter or a masochist, you're more than<lf>welcome to attempt them solo.
<string>If you just like hunting solo and you're<lf>NOT a masochist, I recommend accepting<lf>village quests from Hinoa instead.
<string>Hey, <PL>! Word about the<lf>village is you're an honest-to-goodness<lf>Kamura Hunter now. Congratulations!
<string>If you ever have questions about the<lf>Gathering Hub, I'm your man. Feel<lf>free to ask me anytime.
<string>Hey, <PL>.<lf>Welcome to the Gathering Hub.
<string>Just in case you didn't know, if you're<lf>looking to accept Hub quests, talk to Miss<lf>Minoto over there and she'll set you up.

<string>If you just like hunting solo and you're<lf>NOT a masochist, I recommend accepting<lf>village quests from Hinoa instead.
<string>Don't ever go out that quest gate without<lf>eating a meal. Bunny Dango will do<lf>wonders for your hunts.
<string>And just in case you didn't know,<lf>Otemai runs the Canteen here in<lf>the Gathering Hub.
<string>She's also the one that taught Yomogi<lf>over in the Tea Shop everything she<lf>knows about making dango.
<string>Everything offered here in the Hub's canteen<lf>can also be found in the Tea Shop. Taste is<lf>slightly different, but both are excellent.
<string>Have you met Maido yet? She runs the Hub's<lf>market. Need something before heading out?<lf>She's got you. Check her out next to Minoto.
<string>She used to work with Otemai but,<lf>seeing a business opportunity,<lf>Otemai sent her over there.
<string>Good timing too. The Hub was short on staff<lf>and hunters were complaining about the<lf>lack of a decent place to grab supplies.
<string>And turns out, she's a natural at it.<lf>It's funny how things fall into place<lf>like that sometimes.
<string>Just in case you didn't know, an urgent<lf>quest's come in. Be careful out there.
<string>Don't forget to check you've got all your<lf>equipment and items before you go!
<string>Now that Hinoa's resonating with the<lf>dragon, it's got Minoto down in the<lf>dumps... Everyone in the Hub's worried.
<string>Maido's been trying to cheer her up, but...
<string>Nothing.<lf>It's hard seeing her like this...
<string>The Hub just isn't the same with Minoto<lf>like this. Wish there was something we<lf>could do to get her back to her old self.
<string>Hey, <PL>!<lf>What'll it be today?<lf>Questing as usual?
<string>Minoto's still upset about what happened.<lf>It's breaking her focus too, causing her to<lf>make mistakes. Master Hojo's concerned.
<string>Hey, uh, <PL>?<lf>Think you could take down that<lf>monster and bring our old Minoto back?
<string>I know everyone else hopes you will.<lf>Come on, you got this, Hunter!
<string>Hey, <PL>, I heard<lf>the news. That they found out<lf>the cause of the Rampage.
<string>And basically that cause is Ibushi.<lf>The monsters get freaked out and<lf>start running amok... Crazy!
<string>I guess it's kinda like when Seihaku<lf>pranks Wakana and then she chases<lf>him around?
<string>...What's that? It's not like that at all?<lf>Come on! But it's way funnier to think<lf>of it that way!
<string>Anyway, you've got to defeat Wakana—<lf>I-I mean, uh, Ibushi, yeah. Take down<lf>Ibushi, end the Rampage, done.
<string>Minoto's normally all-business, but her<lf>concentration seems to be totally shaken<lf>over what's happening to her sister.
<string>I don't have siblings, so I gotta say, I think<lf>it's sweet of her to worry like that. Then again,<lf>I do hope things return to normal soon...
<string><PL>!<lf>I can't believe you actually did it!<lf>You really took down Ibushi!
<string>I mean, I was totally sure you'd do it!<lf>But now that it's really happened, it<lf>feels too good to be true.
<string>Whatever else happens, I'm just glad<lf>Minoto is back to her old self! The<lf>Gathering Hub feels complete again.
<string>Thanks a bunch, <PL>!<lf>Take a load off, you deserve it!
<string>Now Minoto's resonating?<lf>If it's not one monster, it's another...
<string>It's kinda crazy, but Minoto looks fine.<lf>Dare I say, even more energetic than<lf>usual. Weird stuff going on here.
<string>She's practically a new person.<lf>What's going on here!?
<string>Hinoa's been coming to the Hub<lf>a lot to check on Minoto.
<string>Whenever she comes to visit, the look on<lf>Minoto's face... I don't think I've ever<lf>seen her so happy before. Kinda freaky.
<string>Well, if it isn't our hero!
<string>Hey now, don't be shy, <PL>!<lf>You're the savior of Kamura! That's as<lf>heroic as you can get!
<string>I heard that both those serpent monsters<lf>are still around.
<string>But if they pop their heads back up,<lf>you'll just whack 'em back down, right?<lf>We don't have to worry thanks to you!
<string>Hey, <PL>! What's up?<lf>Wanna hear about the Hub?
<string>Get outta here!<lf>You know way more about it than I do!
<string>Another day, another quest, huh?<lf>Well, take care!
<string>Looks like they found out where Ibushi and<lf>Narwa were hanging out.
<string>Who knows what's gonna happen next...<lf>Don't get careless now. You gotta make<lf>sure you're not going in unprepared.
<string>I mean, having top equipment is all well and<lf>good, but the most important thing is your<lf>tummy! Don't forget your Bunny Dango!
<string>The end of the Rampage... Never thought<lf>I'd say those words or see it happen,<lf>but I did—thanks to you, <PL>.
<string>I'm planning something to tell your<lf>tale to future generations, so that<lf>they'll know of your deeds.
<string>What about a commemorative tree?<lf>A big one with your name on it, right here!<lf>...Oh. Too much? You think so?
<string>There are a lot of cherry trees in bloom<lf>in the village. To tell you the truth,<lf>I'm the one who takes care of 'em.
<string>Initially, my grandpa did that. I guess<lf>I inherited his green thumb from spending<lf>so much time with him when I was a kid.
<string>Flowers are wonderful. Their very sight<lf>brings peace of mind, don't you think?<lf>Though, they can be fussy. Haha.
<string>Oh, these masks? They were made<lf>by our very own Master Utsushi.
<string>Look how well-made they are!<lf>Utsushi put so much detail into<lf>them. He really knows his stuff!
<string>But, uh...some might say they're<lf>a little TOO detailed.
<string>Well, different strokes, I guess. I think<lf>they're real neat, but nobody else<lf>agrees with me.
<string>What do you think, <PL>?<lf>I mean, you're already here; might<lf>as well buy one, right?
<string>Just before you got here, I was putting<lf>up some new stock and I heard a piercing<lf>howl right behind me!
<string>It freaked me the heck out! I thought<lf>the Rampage was about to come<lf>barreling through the Hub!
<string>I scrambled to my feet and just as I was<lf>about to run out the door, I saw Utsushi<lf>just standing there. Can you believe it!?
<string>I was like, "WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO,<lf>MAN!" And he was like, "Sorry yo! I gotta<lf>keep my monster impressions on point!"
<string>I mean, he does need to practice.<lf>I guess since I was the only one in<lf>the Hub at the time, it was no big deal.
<string>...But jeez! You gotta give me a heads up<lf>or SOMETHING. I nearly had a heart attack!<lf>Hahaha!
<string>After that, I got him to do all his impressions<lf>for me. Was pretty cool. The man's got talent.
<string>Recently, I sold one of Utsushi's<lf>masks for the first time in ages!<lf>Any guesses who the buyer was?
<string>It was Rondine, that trader lady over<lf>at the Buddy Plaza. Strange tastes,<lf>she has.
<string>Oh, and get this. Otemai told me she didn't<lf>even know they were for sale! She was like,<lf>"Oh, you're selling these?"
<string>I guess if we want people to buy them,<lf>we gotta make sure people know they're<lf>for sale! HA!
<string>I've been debating whether I should<lf>put up some signs next to the flowers,<lf>saying what kind of flower they are.
<string>But I'm not much of an artist. I think I can<lf>swing a stick-figure, but even then, I'm not<lf>sure people could make it out.
<string>You know who's great, though? Master<lf>Hojo! All those monsters on the quest<lf>board, that's all him. Cool, huh?
<string>I might ask him to help me. Be a real<lf>shame if there were a bunch of ugly<lf>signs next to all the beautiful flowers.
<string>The Felynes banging on the drum next to<lf>the entrance are brothers. They've earned<lf>the names "Badum" and "Tish."
<string>You just whack a drum to play it, right?<lf>Anybody can do that, right? Boy, did<lf>they prove me wrong!
<string>Hearing them play, it's like the beat<lf>is rising from the earth itself. Really<lf>gets the blood pumping.
<string>I get so fired up and ready to hunt! I'm like,<lf>"YEAH, LET'S DO THIS!" Then I remember that<lf>I'm in fact, NOT a hunter and I sit back down...
<string>The Felynes banging on drums at the<lf>entrance are brothers. They've earned<lf>the names "Badum" and "Tish."
<string>You just smack a drum to play it, right?<lf>So I figured anyone could do it.<lf>Boy, how they proved me wrong!
<string>Hearing them play, it's like the beat<lf>is rising from the earth itself.<lf>It really gets the blood pumping.
<string>I get so fired up and ready to hunt! I'm like,<lf>"YEAH, LET'S DO THIS!" Then I remember that<lf>I'm in fact, NOT a hunter and I sit back down...
<string>Could I ask you a favor?
<string>Sitting here all day I realized how<lf>dull the Gathering Hub can get.
<string>It's beautiful, of course, but a little<lf>change would be nice every now<lf>and then.
<string>I'd like to make a huge paper crane to<lf>spice up the place, but I find myself<lf>stuck at the "picking paper" part.
<string>I think some inspiration would help me<lf>finally settle on a design—an image of<lf>something beautiful and majestic, maybe.
<string>Thanks for helpin' me out!
<string>I can't thank you enough for helping with<lf>my request! Seeing a <COLS RED>Mizutsune</COL> was just<lf>the spark of inspiration I needed!
<string>I finished my crane in no time, and was<lf>planning to surprise you with it...until<lf>I was told it's too big to have in here.
<string>But it would've been a shame to just<lf>scrap it, so I've put it up in my house.
<string>Apparently, though, Nakago and Master Hamon<lf>saw it before I took it down and were struck<lf>with a little inspiration of their own.
<string>If you wanna check it out, why not<lf>pay them a visit?
