<string>We must be ready...
<string><NOFAC><CAM:0>...Hinoa? What is it?<lf>You can see I'm busy here,<lf>preparing for the Rampage.
<string><NPC:35>Now now, Master Hamon, this time<lf>I've come to tell you the good news!
<string><PL> has been accepted<lf>into the Hunter's Guild!
<string>The village now has a resident hunter<lf>we can all count on! Isn't that great?
<string><NPC:5>...Hmph. I see.<lf>Well then, <PL>, allow<lf>me to congratulate you.
<string>The equipment we forge here<lf>is what makes a hunter, in part,<lf>and can make or break a hunt.
<string>It's what represents our village, too.<lf>A hunter who can't wield Tatara Steel<lf>isn't fit to fly the banner of Kamura.
<string>You'll find whatever you need here.<lf>As for crafting and refining gear...<lf>Well, we can talk about that later.
<string><NPC:35>Oh, since we're here, that reminds me!
<string><CAM:6,1>You can hire Buddies at<lf>the Buddy Plaza up ahead.
<string>And Master Hamon's grandson,<lf>Iori, manages the place. Why<lf>don't you go talk to him later?
<string><NPC:5>Hmph. Capering around with<lf>Felynes and Canynes. Makes me<lf>wonder where I went wrong...
<string><NPC:35><CAM:6,0>Really? I think Buddy Handling<lf>is quite a noble profession,<lf>personally.
<string>Anyway, Master Hamon.<lf>I was wondering if my order<lf>was ready yet.
<string><NPC:5>It is. One of my apprentices'll<lf>deliver it to you later.
<string><NPC:35><VO:SP1>OK. Just one more stop, and<lf>we're done... Let's see.
<string><CAM:2,3,4,5><VO:NOR>"Sweeter than sweet dango!"<lf>It's got to be <COLS RED>Yomogi the Chef</COL>'s<lf>Tea Shop!
<string>An excellent idea...
<string><NOFAC><FCAM>...Hmph, you're here.
<string>Do you know of the monster, <COLS RED>Bishaten</COL>?<lf>It's a fanged, thick-tailed beast with<lf>unpredictable movements.
<string>It's attacking anyone passing through<lf>the Shrine Ruins. An urgent quest<lf>has been issued for you to hunt it.
<string>...What are you still doing here?
<string>Hmph, you need a reason, do you?<lf>Very well.
<string>Right now, you—no, all of Kamura<lf>hasn't got the strength or means to<lf>take on Magnamalo AND the Rampage.
<string>It feeds on the horde to gain power.<lf>You can try and kill it, but it'll just<lf>eat even more to restore its strength.
<string>So, what we need to do is separate<lf>it from the horde. And I'm devising<lf>a way to do just that...
<string>In order to finish my device,<lf>I need materials from Bishaten.<lf>Which just showed up at the Ruins.
<string>The construction itself is...<lf>No, forget it. Time's short.
<string>We'll talk when it's done. Right now,<lf>I just need you to hunt Bishaten.
<string><NOFAC><FCAM>Masterfully done.<lf>Thanks to you, the device is ready<lf>to go at the Stronghold.
<string>With this, we can divide Magnamalo<lf>and the Rampage, and prevent it<lf>from regaining its strength.
<string>...Hm? You still want to know how<lf>it works? Fine, I'll explain it to you.<lf>It's complicated, so listen well.
<string>The flesh and blood of the Rampage<lf>is extremely nutritious to Magnamalo.<lf>That's why it always follows the horde.
<string>Its nose is amazingly sensitive<lf>to the frenzy. We'll use that very<lf>quality against it.
<string>This is where Bishaten comes in:<lf>Its stomach is perfect for aging meat.<lf>For the monster palate, anyway.
<string>We stuffed fresh meat from a rampaging<lf>monster into the stomach. Soon, it'll be<lf>pungent enough to draw Magnamalo here.
<string>But my contraption, with the stomach<lf>inside it, will lure Magnamalo into one<lf>of the Stronghold's secret passages.
<string>You'll be waiting at the end of it, and<lf>the rest is up to you.
<string>"Kamura is more than steel and hunters."
<string>My device was my answer to Fugen's<lf>words, in a way only a blacksmith<lf>knows how...
<string>Since you helped me make it,<lf>I'd like to give you this in exchange.
<string><NOFAC><FCAM>I'm busy.<lf>Come back later.
<string><NOFAC><FCAM>So, you're a hunter, <PL>...<lf>Well, you're not lacking in the skill for it.
<string>But being a good hunter requires<lf>having good gear. Come talk to<lf>me if you need some.
<string>Decided on a weapon yet?
<string>You need to determine which style suits<lf>you, and which weapons will be effective<lf>against each quest's target.
<string>There's a Training Area past the Plaza<lf>where you can test everything out.
<string>Decided on a weapon yet?
<string>You need to determine which style suits<lf>you, and which weapons will be effective<lf>against each quest's target.
<string>There's a Training Area past the Plaza<lf>where you can test everything out.
<string>Been to see Yomogi yet?
<string>She's been looking for you.<lf>Seemed troubled.
<string>...Her voice sure carries a long way.<lf>Fitting for a salesgirl, I suppose.
<string>So, a Great Izuchi has appeared.
<string>It'll try to attack in coordination with<lf>smaller Izuchi, but as long as you watch<lf>your back, it'll be no match for you.
<string>If something happens to that delivery,<lf>and Yomogi can't make those dango...
<string>Well, if you want to keep getting<lf>quests from Hinoa, you'd better<lf>see this taken care of, and fast.
<string><VO:SER>Have you seen Iori, lately?
<string>I...worry for his future sometimes.<lf>Nothing wrong with handling, but<lf>to forgo family tradition like that...
<string>I know an old man like me has<lf>no right to complain. But still,<lf>I...I just—Nevermind.
<string>My grandson wants to talk to you.
<string>Sorry to bother you, but could you<lf>go see what he wants? He'll be with<lf>his little friends in the Buddy Plaza.
<string>Thanks for helping my grandson.<lf>Good luck hunting Aknosom.
<string>Iori'll take care of the Buddies<lf>with the other villagers' help.
<string>So don't let concern distract you.<lf>Just carry on hunting, and watch<lf>yourself out there.
<string>My grandson caused you such<lf>trouble, but you resolved it yourself<lf>all the same. You have my gratitude.
<string>I went to see the Shrine Ruins myself.<lf>You're right, there's something going<lf>on there. Something troubling...
<string>Not from a rampaging monster.<lf>Definitely from no ghost. But,<lf>whatever it was, it was immense.
<string><PL>, careful out there.
<string><VO:SER>The Rampage is upon us.<lf>Got all your gear in order?
<string>It won't be like the one fifty years ago.<lf>This time, we'll protect Kamura from<lf>every last one of those monsters.
<string>The Stronghold is near the Ruins.<lf>That unknown presence is still there.<lf>Watch it out there.
<string><VO:SER>So, that presence in the Shrine<lf>Ruins was Magnamalo.
<string>I faced that beast fifty years ago,<lf>alongside Fugen and Hojo...<lf>And now it bares its fangs again.
<string><PL>.<lf>I hear Fugen's handed down the task<lf>of hunting Magnamalo to you.
<string>I trust that you will carry it out without fail.<lf>I'd hunt Magnamalo myself, but these old<lf>bones won't let me.
<string><VO:SER>That wretched beast! First the village,<lf>and now Iori!
<string>If only I'd still the strength to take<lf>it down myself. But at my age...<lf>I'd be helpless, damn it all.
<string>And yet, I can't stand back<lf>and do nothing!
<string><VO:SER>Without material from Bishaten,<lf>I can't complete my device to help<lf>bring down Magnamalo.
<string>You'll have every chance to<lf>see it when it's ready.<lf>For now, go. Hunt.
<string>With your help, the device is<lf>finished. All that's left now is<lf>to wait for our target to appear.
<string>If we can separate it from the Rampage,<lf>you just might be able to—<lf>No. I know you'll be able beat it.
<string>The defeat I've harbored for fifty years,<lf>and now...my grandson's life is at risk.<lf><PL>! You cannot fail!
<string><VO:SER>Before, with Kamura on the brink<lf>of destruction, I faced Magnamalo.<lf>But I failed to destroy it.
<string>And this time, Iori was in danger.<lf>But I could have done nothing<lf>to save him...
<string>I'd do anything to be able to fight<lf>like I used to again, anything.<lf>I hate feeling so helpless...
<string><PL>. The device is<lf>my last hurrah in this long, long fight<lf>against Magnamalo.
<string>I can't finish this fight, but you can.<lf>I'm counting on you.
<string>In hunting Magnamalo, the shadow<lf>it cast upon me all this time has<lf>finally been lifted.
<string>Can't thank you enough. You've<lf>become a masterful hunter...<lf>I'm sure Fugen and Hojo agree.
<string>But the village is still far from safe.<lf>We can't rest yet.
<string>And...Iori deeply respects you. If you<lf>don't mind, it would...be nice if you'd<lf>check in on him, every now and again.
<string>Recently, it feels like Iori has become<lf>so much more of a grown man.
<string>And as a result of all these dealings<lf>with Magnamalo, I can respect Iori's<lf>decision.
<string>I suppose it was my judgement I<lf>went wrong with, not him. The best<lf>thing I can do now is admit to it.
<string>I realized that thanks to you. When<lf>peace returns to Kamura, why don't<lf>the three of us enjoy a meal together?
<string>...Don't think I'm only inviting you<lf>because it'd be awkward with<lf>just Iori and myself, though.
<string>You'll find my apprentice,<lf>Nakago on the second floor<lf>of the Gathering Hub.
<string>He's a bit of an odd duck, but I can<lf>vouch for his skills. He'll be with<lf>Kojiri, who's equally talented.
<string>You'll be spending a lot of time doing<lf>Gathering Hub quests so you can put<lf>your trust in their work.
<string>We've received word from the Hub<lf>that the Rampage is coming.
<string>You'll be outnumbered like never before.<lf>Be sure to prepare your equipment well.
<string>Hojo means to end the cycle of<lf>calamities with this Rampage.
<string>Doing so requires solving the age-old<lf>mystery of why Rampages even happen.
<string>You working with Hojo and<lf>the Guild is our best shot at<lf>finding that out.
<string>And our best shot at Kamura Village's<lf>long-term survival, too. We can't afford<lf>to let these disasters go on...
<string>There's a hunter by the name of<lf>Ayame at the Gathering Hub.<lf>She was born here in Kamura,
<string>but left as a child and became<lf>a hunter much later on in life,<lf>so you wouldn't know her.
<string>She's returned in bad shape.<lf>It's looking like that hunt<lf>might have been her last.
<string>It's a cruel fate for any hunter.<lf>I just hope she can accept it<lf>and find a new purpose...
<string>You're leaner lately. One look at<lf>your build says you've been<lf>completing quests from the Hub.
<string>Take care you don't burn yourself out.<lf>Hojo's careful not to let you notice,<lf>but he's always worrying about you.
<string>You're like a grandchild to him. He's<lf>always boasting that you two have<lf>"the exact same looks and personality."
<string>...What?<lf>Something I said?
<string>The Hub reports that the Rampage<lf>is drawing closer. This time, it's in<lf>the company of an Apex Arzuros.
<string>Apex monsters command strength AND<lf>the lesser monsters around them.<lf>Really watch your back with this one.
<string><VO:SER>We've staved off the horde, but the<lf>appearance of this azure elder dragon,<lf>and what it did to Hinoa...
<string>Nothing about either bodes well,<lf>not for Hinoa, nor for any of us.<lf>The whole village can feel it.
<string><PL>...<lf>The hunt is on now more than ever.<lf>You have no choice but to defeat it.
<string><VO:SER>Dark clouds blotted out the sun<lf>as gales raged and lightning<lf>relentlessly split the sky.
<string>Then, when the storm passed,<lf>the hordes of the Rampage emerged.
<string>It was so back then, and again now.<lf>While you were away, training with<lf>Utsushi, there was a terrible storm.
<string>When it passed, sure enough,<lf>word of the migration's arrival<lf>spread throughout Kamura.
<string>Who knows how the storm and<lf>the Rampage are connected,<lf>but it can't be a coincidence...
<string><VO:SER>Ages past, the Wind Serpent Ibushi<lf>would lead the Rampage, but why<lf>would it appear before us now?
<string>It must have something to do<lf>with Hinoa. Perhaps her strange<lf>affinity with it called it here.
<string>Regardless, this is your chance.<lf>Hunt the beast and save Kamura!<lf>You're the only one who can.
<string>The time has finally come<lf>to hunt the Wind Serpent.<lf>Check that your gear's good.
<string>That's all I have to say. I already<lf>know you'll make Kamura Village<lf>proud.
<string>Ibushi may have escaped, but it won't<lf>survive long with injuries like those...<lf>Least that's what the Guild says.
<string>You've already achieved more than<lf>any hunter in Kamura's history...
<string>But the calamity rages on,<lf>with no sign of letting up yet.<lf>Be prepared in every way.
<string><VO:SER>Ibushi's "queen..."<lf>The Thunder Serpent Narwa.
<string>Hah. It almost makes for a tragic tale<lf>of two storm-crossed lovers.
<string>The desperate pain of their separation<lf>so strong, it sends every nearby monster<lf>into a frenzy while they seek reunion...
<string>And remain blind to the suffering of<lf>humans and monsters caught in<lf>the crossfire for centuries.
<string>If we're to be free of this cycle,<lf>we can never allow king and<lf>queen to be reunited.
<string>Now that I think of it, the day this<lf>Rampage began was the very same<lf>that you became a hunter.
<string>I'd say that was a tough starting break<lf>for any other hunter, but in this case,<lf>perhaps it was some odd sort of fate.
<string>You could say your hunter's journey<lf>began with the Rampage.
<string>And, if it ends with you ending<lf>the Rampage itself, well...<lf>There could be no greater honor.
<string>Go on, now. Make that your ending.<lf>We, your kinsmen, will be here,<lf>smiling as we await your return.
<string><VO:SER>What happened to Hinoa and<lf>Minoto must mean Ibushi and<lf>Narwa are both still alive.
<string>Damn, a reunion of the two<lf>could spell doom for us all...
<string><PL>.<lf>It seems the hunt isn't<lf>over for you just yet.
<string><VO:SER>So Ibushi and Narwa have reunited...<lf>That is unsettling news, indeed.
<string><VO:NOR>But you've faced these two before<lf>and emerged victorious. Surely this<lf>time will be no different...
<string>However, please be careful.<lf>And come back to us safe.<lf>We'll be waiting for you.
<string>*chuckle* I might have had a bit too much<lf>to drink at the feast. I can't remember<lf>the last time I indulged myself like that.
<string>You did it, <PL>. You really<lf>did it... You freed Kamura from<lf>the clutches of the Rampage.
<string>I'll write a song about it...accompanied<lf>by the sonorous strings of my lute.<lf>I'll play it for you when I'm done.
<string>It'll be called "The Saviour of Kamura."<lf>A title fitting for the decorum you've<lf>showed.
<string>Don't be shy. You've saved many<lf>lives from a great calamity. Be<lf>proud of that.
<string>But don't get complacent. Many monsters<lf>still await you—a hunter's work is never<lf>truly done. Keeps your wits about you.
<string>The Tatara Steel we produce here in<lf>Kamura is prized by people far and wide.
<string>All manner of weaponry made from it<lf>is far superior to that made from iron<lf>and more common forms of steel.
<string>That is why, <PL>,<lf>you must treat your arms with care.<lf>The name of Kamura depends on it.
<string>Mihaba, here, is one of my<lf>apprenticing blacksmiths.
<string>Well, his apprenticeship is on hold<lf>right now, on account of the Rampage.<lf>He mainly maintains equipment.
<string>He's so dedicated, he has little time<lf>for anything but smithing. I think he'd<lf>learn a lot from accounts of your hunts.
<string>Say hello to him if you find the time.<lf>But, if he starts talking bout Hinoa...<lf>Well, feel free to ignore him.
<string>Have you met the trader at the Plaza?<lf>I hear she came from a far-off country<lf>just to sell her wares in this village.
<string>But, judging from her behavior,<lf>I'd say she's a hunter in the service<lf>of some noble master or another.
<string>Meaning she's not here to trade. I reckon<lf>she really came to learn from Kamura's<lf>craftsmen and their techniques.
<string>But, don't worry. I can tell she has<lf>too much respect for us to try<lf>to poach anyone or anything.
<string>Besides, she has no idea<lf>the whole village's worked out<lf>why she's really here.
<string>Revealing that we know would do more<lf>harm to her pride than to us. Better to<lf>keep up the ruse and a close eye on her.

<string>I made the Toadversary in the<lf>Training Area to help prepare the<lf>villagers to face the Rampage.
<string>You must've been scared when you first<lf>saw it. Well, you'll be reassured to<lf>know that was what I intended.
<string>Fighting monsters from a young age means<lf>I'm good at mimicking their terrifying<lf>characteristics in my work like that.
<string>The children call it cute, but they're<lf>obviously just trying to hide their fear.<lf>They're the cute ones.
<string>The real reason I have never accepted<lf>Iori's decision has nothing to do with<lf>family tradition...
<string>I suppose now that you're a fine young<lf>adult in your own right, I can tell you,<lf>but, well... I...have a fear of Canynes.
<string>When I was very young, I...<lf>was bitten by Canyne stray.
<string>Even when I hunted, the only Buddies<lf>I'd have were Felynes. When Fugen and<lf>Hojo rode Canynes, I'd run after them.
<string>...Only Fugen and Hojo know<lf>about this. I'd appreciate it if you<lf>didn't mention it to anyone else.
<string>Seeing your great deeds,<lf>I can't help but reminisce on<lf>my youth, out on the hunt.
<string>Despite my age and retirement...<lf>Something in my blood still hears<lf>its call.
<string>Fugen and Hojo are no different,<lf>especially Fugen. He often<lf>considers becoming a hunter again.
<string>Should peace return to Kamura Village<lf>for good, I suppose we might all<lf>return to the hunt, like before.
<string>If that time comes, <PL>,<lf>join us and we'll show you how us<lf>veterans hunt!
<string>I have an important matter to discuss.
<string><NOFAC>Fail to take your means of protection<lf>seriously, and you won't last long out<lf>in the field. You can imagine why.
<string>Improve your armor by <COLS RED>upgrading</COL> it<lf>here at my smithy. Make sure to bring<lf>the needed <COL RED>armor spheres</COL> with you.
<string>I'll start you off with a few, as<lf>a beginner's gift. Use them to<lf>upgrade your gear.

<string>I have an important matter to discuss.
<string><NOFAC>Ah, <PL>. There's something<lf>I should tell you about.
<string>I've devised a special new technique to<lf>upgrade weapons, in order to further<lf>better our chances against the Rampage.
<string>I call it <COLS RED>Ramping-Up</COL>. It uses materials from<lf>the Rampage to enhance weapons far more<lf>than any normal means would be capable.
<string>When you've collected the necessary<lf>materials, bring them here and I'll show you.

<string><NOFAC>Ah, <PL>.<lf>I see you haven't been dilly-dallying in<lf>your training.
<string>Serious hunts require serious steel,<lf>so I've readied the forges to make<lf>powerful <COLS RED>Ramped-Up</COL> weapons.
<string>There are Apex monsters out in the Rampage...<lf>They carry precious materials that take very<lf>well to the Ramping-Up process.
<string>I can forge them as I have your<lf>other weapons in the past. If your<lf>weaponry is lacking, you'd best try it.
<string>I have an important matter to discuss.
<string><NOFAC>I've some good news for you, <PL>.<lf>The Smithy has decided to start forging<lf><COLS RED>decorations</COL>.
<string>Decorations let you tap into the power of<lf>skills. All you have to do is slot them into<lf>a piece of armor here or from your item box.
<string>You'll need <COLS RED>jewels</COL> to forge them,<lf>so please bring some with you<lf>whenever you want any made.
<string>And we'll be increasing the types of<lf>decorations you can forge in the near<lf>future, so check back with us soon.
<string>I have an important matter to discuss.
<string><NOFAC>It took some help from Nakago and the<lf>others, but we can now forge more kinds<lf>of decorations for you.
<string>You'll be faced with some grueling hunts<lf>from here on, I'm sure... Make sure your<lf>gear doesn't leave you lacking.

<string>Honestly, it's not the sort of thing I would<lf>have ever thought of—Nakago suggested it;<lf>said it might help to keep your spirits up.
<string>Try it out for yourself, why don't you?<lf>Here, have this Outfit Voucher so you<lf>can do just that.

<string>The Rampage...
<string>For our next maneuver...
