<string>I've got Palamute info for ya!
<string>Oh, hey there! Is it, you? And by you,<lf>I mean, <PL>? Oh, awesome!<lf>It IS you! I'm Gatlyn! Pleased to meet ya!
<string>They still treat me like I'm new around<lf>here... Well, actually, I am...
<string>But I'm a fast learner and a champ at note-<lf>taking! And I have some of the best notes<lf>ever taked-ed-ed! *ahem* Here, I'll show ya!
<string>We've been working on something useful for<lf>your Palamutes and—BOOM!—we came up<lf>with TWO somethings!
<string>Something number one is the <COLS RED>Palamute<lf>Pouch</COL>! And something numero two-o<lf>is the <COL RED>Sniff 'em out</COL> command!
<string>Ever find yourself out on a quest with a full<lf>item pouch? Well the next time you do, you<lf>can stuff your stuff in your pooch's pouch!
<string><NOTE:413>Use the Palamute Pouch to <COLS RED>carry extra items</COL>!<lf>And you don't even have to equip it! Just<lf>bring your Palamute with you on a quest!
<string><NOTE:414>With the Sniff 'em out! command, you can use<lf>your pooch's snoot to—you guessed it!—"sniff<lf>out" specific items or endemic life for ya!
<string>Isn't that something—er, TWO somethings!?<lf>Make your woof woofs work for you!
<string>Now if you don't mind, I've got hearts to break<lf>and notes to take! OK, no heartbreaking, but<lf>DEFINITELY note taking! See ya!
<string>I've got Palamute info for ya!
<string>Oh, hey there, <PL>! I was<lf>JUST talking to your pal Inukai from over<lf>in Kamura and we're so excited because...
<string>We've been working on something useful for<lf>your Palamutes and—BOOM!—we came up<lf>with TWO somethings!
<string>Something number one is the <COLS RED>Palamute<lf>Pouch</COL>! And something numero two-o<lf>is the <COL RED>Sniff 'em out</COL> command!

<string>Now if you don't mind, I've got hearts to break<lf>and notes to take! OK, no heartbreaking, but<lf>DEFINITELY note taking! See ya!
<string>I want to chat about Palamutes!
<string>I might not look it, but I'm an up-and-<lf>coming engineer myself! No one can beat<lf>me when it comes to curiosity!
<string>Now, what I want to chat about, is this<lf>Palamute Gear you've got going on. I can<lf>see some exciting room for improvement!
<string>I think I can click and clank and crank<lf>out some doggie toys! I can't really<lf>explain, but it'll be awesome, promise!
<string>My curiosity knows no bounds! Help me<lf>find the materials it demands for me!<lf>The technological revolution is near!
<string>Hey! Hello again! Thanks so much for<lf>finding those things I needed.
<string>You're the best! I've completed some new<lf>Palamute Gear, thanks to you—and it's<lf>really cool, if I say so myself!
<string>I'll even give you one as a thank you!<lf>I want lots of feedback, so make<lf>sure to use it all around!
<string>I feel a connection between us! Two<lf>inquisitive minds, thrown together!<lf>We're comrades in creation now!
<string>I'm sorry I didn't notice! I can't really<lf>remember anything unless I write it down.
<string>Oh...! Could it be? Are you by any chance<lf><PL>? The name's Gatlyn!
<string>They still treat me like I'm new around here...<lf>Well, actually, I am...
<string>But I guess that means I can be considered<lf>as a promising up-and-comer!
<string><PL>... Just in time.<lf>Sue has just finished my daily scolding<lf>session...
<string>It's always the same thing with her, day<lf>in and day out. Surely she must be sick<lf>of repeating herself all the time.
<string>Is it possible that I'm making the same<lf>mistakes? I could have sworn I wrote<lf>everything down... I need to check!
<string>Well then, it's almost quitting time...
<string>I think we've done more than enough work<lf>for one day, so let's leave the cleaning up<lf>for tomorrow and head home early!
<string>...Huh? I can feel Sue's cold gaze staring<lf>right through my soul, but maybe it's<lf>just my imagination...
<string>Hello there, <PL>!<lf>Would you say it's about time to go on<lf>a quest?
<string>In that case, you can leave supporting<lf>the base to me.
<string>Thanks to me, all of Elgado's facilities are<lf>in pristine condition!
<string>I'm sure I'll be even busier once the investi-<lf>gation into the Kingdom's monsters gets<lf>into full swing.
<string>I could ask for nothing less!<lf>A great woman sees great results!<lf>At least that's my theory!
<string>Oh, did you find something in the Jungle?<lf>I wouldn't last long out there, I can assure<lf>you of that. Far too humid for me!
<string>Leave anything alone and it will eventually<lf>rust. Moisture is the sworn enemy of<lf>maintenance, wouldn't you say?
<string>.......<lf>...Oh no, I just remembered!<lf>I need to restock the rust-proofing!
<string>What on earth was that just now?<lf>Did you hear that loud voice?
<string>For a moment there I thought I was<lf>the angry one...
<string>Sue, you've had a serious look on your face<lf>for a while now. Is something the matter?
<string>Oh! I see, I get it now!
<string>You need to use the toilet right?<lf>Go now, we can wait!
<string>We can't have you holding it in now,<lf>can we? OK, I'll take over for you<lf>for a bit!
<string>Huh? Bahari hasn't come back yet?
<string>I just adjusted the crane's arm to<lf>a better position, and wanted to ask<lf>his opinion...
<string>Hmm... Awww heck with it!<lf>I'll ask Sue what she thinks!
<string>If any rampaging monster damages any of<lf>the villages nearby, it's our job to provide<lf>and operate equipment to make repairs.
<string>...of course, only when it's safe to do so.<lf>That part we leave to you, <PL>!
<string>Do you have a moment, <PL>?<lf>I'd like to hear the opinion of an experienced<lf>hunter such as yourself.
<string>We're currently renovating Elgado's facilities,<lf>let us know if there's anything you think we<lf>can improve.
<string>You never truly understand what the people<lf>are thinking unless you actually listen to<lf>what they have to say.
<string>Going out to capture a monster, huh?<lf>Perhaps a box, or a cage or something<lf>like that would come in handy?
<string>At least if you know the size of the beast,<lf>you can start to prepare. I'm sure there's<lf>something around here that might be of use.
<string>Understood! I'll check with Bahari and<lf>make ready for the capture!
<string>I caught a glimpse of one of those Qurio.<lf>They sure give me the heebie-jeebies!
<string>Feels like I've just woken up from a dream.<lf>I'll need to find some way to help me forget<lf>about that monstrosity.
<string>Perhaps I'll go and pay Sue a visit. She is<lf>obviously trying to hide how tired she is,<lf>but is failing miserably at it!
<string>Those guys from The Order are acting all<lf>serious all of a sudden. Perhaps it's time<lf>I showed my serious side too!
<string>I think I'll start with a serious expression<lf>on my face, yeah...that should help me<lf>fit right in for sure!
<string>..........<lf>...Wait!<lf>I can't believe I just said that!
<string>Doctor Tadori has a unique air about him.<lf>He is different from Bahari, calmer and<lf>more professional.
<string>If I can act the same way he does,<lf>perhaps people will consider me more<lf>capable.
<string>From those creepy looking Qurio to the<lf>poisonous Espinas, you hunters sure do<lf>have it rough.
<string>Compared to you, all I have to put up with<lf>are checking the grease levels, and trying<lf>not to get run over by the Spelunker.
<string>Getting scolded by Sue over and over<lf>again would be a piece of cake for you.<lf>You have my respect!
<string>So you're finally going to take it down.<lf>It's time to get pumped up!
<string>I'll be skipping work to cheer you on!<lf>Please give it your all out there!
<string>Welcome back! As you can see,<lf>I've written down everything you've<lf>done in my journal!
<string>Oh yeah! I'd also like to ask you how<lf>it feels to have achieved such a feat!<lf>Was it difficult?
<string>Hmmm... OK, got it! I'll write that down<lf>as well!
<string>It appears the Qurio are still on the<lf>move out there. But how is this possible<lf>without a host?
<string>Could it be? Since they don't have anyone<lf>telling them what to do, they're more relaxed<lf>than usual?
<string>Kinda like how it is when Sue's off-duty,<lf>it's the only time we can relax around here...<lf>Only kidding!
<string>Thanks for your hard work, <PL>!<lf>I just came from making the final adjustments<lf>on that huge ship!
<string>Rest easy friend, besides myself,<lf>all of Elgado's equipment teams<lf>are making ready to depart.
<string>So go ahead and take it easy for<lf>a while, <PL>!
<string>Guess what! I've got some good news!<lf>They finally said I can cover some jobs<lf>around here by myself!
<string>I guess I've graduated from being the<lf>newbie. But if I start going solo Sue<lf>might start to miss me.
<string>I'll have to screw up once in a while to<lf>give Sue an excuse to come scold me.<lf>I'm sure she'll appreciate that.
<string>I still have to rely on those more<lf>experienced than I, but I'll be on<lf>their level soon enough!
<string>My maintenance and servicing skills<lf>will surely shine through!
<string>Even Sue says it all the time! At least<lf>I think that's what she's trying to say,<lf>if you read between the lines...
<string>Elgado was once a fortress, that's why<lf>it has such solid foundations.
<string>That explains why this place has<lf>such a military atmosphere to it.
<string>Also...this may be irrelevant,<lf>but the beds are also very hard,<lf>which makes it difficult to sleep...
<string>I heard intuition is important for craftsmen.<lf>Good thing I'm great at using my intuition<lf>to keep things functional.
<string>Sure, sometimes things go a little wrong,<lf>but what doesn't kill you makes you<lf>stronger, right?
<string>I think that's why we have people like<lf>Sue here to guide us. Which means<lf>my failures, are her failures!
<string>The cry of the chimney steam<lf>and the creaking of the crane<lf>arm. I love it!
<string>I know it doesn't sound any different<lf>to you, but when something's broken<lf>it sounds a little different to me.
<string>You probably don't care about any of<lf>this, do you? Well, if you find yourself<lf>curious, I'll teach you anytime!
<string>By the way, <PL>,<lf>don't you want to ride the Spelunker?<lf>We get a lot of requests like that.
<string>But it's too dangerous. Even if I tried<lf>to modify it so it could be ridden,<lf>the Guild would never allow it.
<string>Well, just between you and me,<lf>they let me ride on it once...<lf>That thrill...addictive, isn't it?
<string>Before I knew it, my work journal<lf>turned into an "observation diary<lf>of everyone in Elgado."
<string>I think the one with the most pages<lf>is the one that details your amazing<lf>performances, <PL>!
<string>I should keep a record of this for posterity!<lf>But then people will know I haven't been<lf>filling out my work journal daily.
<string>...Hmm, no... No.<lf>There's nothing unusual about it.<lf>Oh, hey there <PL>.
<string>I thought I'd take a break from my work<lf>to help out a little with the investigation<lf>into the crater.
<string>You see, I have the opportunity to<lf>take part in something that could<lf>be a great discovery!
<string>The size of the crater makes me realize<lf>how truly small my problems are.
<string>I'm not sure what to think anymore...<lf>I guess it doesn't matter much now<lf>anyway!
<string>This crater really does make you take<lf>a long hard look at your life.
<string>Please! Lend me a hand!
<string>When I say "bull," you say "fango!"<lf>This sucks, <PL>!<lf>I really need your help!
<string>I've been tasked with repairs to the<lf>Spelunker, but I don't have half the<lf>materials! I can't work like this!
<string>What? You'll fetch me what I need?<lf>You might even have it already?<lf><PL>, you're the best!
<string>I'm looking for ore called Iridescent<lf>Bismuth Prism. My notes tell that you<lf>can mine them in the Lava Caverns.
<string>Thanks so much!
<string>You collected what I needed! Now I can<lf>fix the Spelunker up, no hassle. Phew!<lf>I thought I was in a fix myself!
<string>I need to thank you properly, of course.<lf>Here you go. A cute Cohoot outfit!<lf>I hope your feathered friend likes it!
<string>You always help me out so much. I need<lf>to buck up and start pulling my own weight!
