<string>Might I ask a favor?
<string>I know you're busy, but I was wondering<lf>if you could assist me in procuring some<lf>materials I need.
<string>Could I trouble you to bring me a Diablos<lf>horn? Monster horn is a fine ingredient<lf>for medicines and elixirs.
<string>I normally gather my own ingredients,<lf>but procuring the horn of a beast such<lf>a Diablos is no easy feat.
<string>And as an added incentive, if you'll<lf>help me, I shall share a way to<lf>strengthen a certain bow.
<string>It appears the medicine can<lf>now be made.
<string>Oh, marvelous. That is a fine horn indeed!<lf>Thank you very much. This is exactly what<lf>I needed!
<string>And you brought it to me with such haste.<lf>What a remarkable hunter you are.
<string>Now, I've already told the Smithy the<lf>method in which to strengthen the bow.<lf>Go there if you wish to inquire further.

<string>I've been a doctor for some time.
<string>As you know, when the plague was ravaging<lf>the Kingdom fifty years ago, I concocted<lf>a medicine to cure the afflicted.
<string>If the Qurio were to blame for that plague,<lf>then my medicine should work for Lady Fiorayne.
<string>Sadly none of it is left, but worry not,<lf>more shall be prepared as quickly as<lf>Wyverianly possible!
<string>Thank you for agreeing to hunt<lf>that Espinas. I can only apologize<lf>for putting you in this position.
<string>Kagero has written of your exploits<lf>numerous times, so I know you're<lf>more than up to the task.
<string>I wish I could make the medicine with what<lf>I have on hand, but sadly I cannot. Again,<lf>I apologize for causing you such trouble.
<string>I can't thank you enough for hunting<lf>that Espinas.
<string>Now I'll do my part and prepare Lady<lf>Fiorayne's medicine.
<string>Even as a newcomer to Elgado, one can see<lf>how her condition affects the atmosphere<lf>here. But fear not, she'll soon be well.
<string>I'm so pleased that Lady Fiorayne is<lf>back on her feet!
<string>As expected, the atmosphere in Elgado<lf>has lightened.
<string>However, she's departing to battle Malzeno.<lf>Troubling indeed...
<string>I hear the monster has some special<lf>significance for the people of Elgado.<lf>Well, I can only pray for your safety.
<string>What can I say? How incredible that you<lf>defeated Malzeno!
<string>But I fear the worst is still to come...<lf>And Admiral Galleus shares my sentiment.
<string>For now, let us hope that our fears<lf>are groundless...
<string><VO:SER>...Absorbing life!? Clearly, a completely<lf>different situation to that of the plague<lf>all those years ago...
<string>If there's anything I can do...<lf>Anything at all, just let me know.
<string>The way the sky looks, I wouldn't be<lf>surprised if new trouble is on the way.<lf>Look after yourself.
<string>I first came to the Kingdom after learning<lf>of the plague running rampant.
<string>So I wasn't present for Malzeno's abhorrent<lf>attack or any of the rumbling growls from<lf>underground.
<string>However when Galleus's home was struck,<lf>he heard those eerie sounds bellowing from<lf>below. It must have been terrifying...
<string>Despite all this, I'm quite confident we shall<lf>overcome this peril. We have you, conqueror<lf>of Malzeno, and the Royal Order to count on.
<string>What superb work! I never doubted you, but...<lf>I'm relieved to see you back safe anyway!
<string>And with the crisis over, I was thinking of<lf>departing soon. However, Oboro expressed<lf>that he'd like to talk to me more...
<string>Perhaps I shall remain in Elgado a tad longer.<lf>It is such a wonderful place.
<string>If you find time in your busy schedule,<lf>I'd be delighted to sit down and hear<lf>all about your adventures.
<string>It was when I was studying herbs around<lf>Elgado that Oboro took it upon himself<lf>to become my student.
<string>I was gathering flora when he suddenly<lf>appeared out of nowhere and started<lf>watching my every move.
<string>Apparently he found the idea of studying<lf>plants in the field to classify them and<lf>identify their properties rather novel.
<string>Why it moved him so, I do not know,<lf>but he asked to study under me then<lf>and there.
<string>I had no reason to turn him down, really.<lf>And I thought, if my knowledge could be<lf>of use, why not?
<string>Though the truth is, I'm always working<lf>in the field, so I wonder how effective<lf>of a teacher I can really be...
<string>Both Kagero and I were hunters back<lf>in our home village.
<string>But being fond of academic study, I took<lf>up medicine. Meanwhile Kagero, with his<lf>talent for weapons, rose to greatness.
<string>Then one day, when I was gathering<lf>herbs out in the field, our village suffered<lf>a horrendous attack by monsters.
<string>When I returned, there was nothing left.<lf>Everything a smoldering ruin...<lf>Everyone gone...
<string>Since then, I've thrown myself into my<lf>studies of medicine even more. At least<lf>there are some I can save that way.
<string>And that meant I've not really laid my<lf>hat anywhere since, as it were. Very<lf>different to Kagero in so many ways.
<string>During my stay here in Elgado, it would<lf>be a waste not to visit Kamura.
<string>Perhaps...you would accompany me<lf>when I go?
<string>It's been so long, I'm...a little nervous<lf>to see Kagero again...
