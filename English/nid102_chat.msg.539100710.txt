<string>The Rampage is before us!<lf>Prepare yourself!
<string>It was a successful defense.<lf>Phew, I was worried for a moment...
<string>It's hopeless...<lf>Quickly, fall back!
<string>An excellent achievement.<lf>Let us return home.
<string>The Stronghold has been<lf>compromised, but we did it...
<string>That makes one mission complete.<lf>Your skills are admirable.
<string>You've completed every mission.<lf>You are quite formidable...
<string>We have a new mission.<lf>Awaiting your confirmation.
<string>A horde approaches!<lf>Now, to arms!
<string>The next wave comes.<lf>Don't get careless...
<string>This is the final wave!<lf>Do not give them an inch!
<string>They're attacking the gates!<lf>Stop them!
<string>One of the gates has been destroyed!<lf>But we're not done yet!
<string>Our defenses are compromised!<lf>The horde must be purged!
<string>The final gate is under attack!<lf>It's now or never!
<string>If that gate falls, the Stronghold is lost!
<string>Gate Breaker spotted!<lf>Focus your attention to it!
<string>Targeter spotted!<lf>Be careful!
<string>Targeter spotted!<lf>Stay vigilant!
<string>Ibushi, overhead!<lf>I won't rest until I've avenged Hinoa!
<string>Monsters are attacking!<lf>Keep your guard up!
<string>A powerful foe approaches—<lf>ugh, now of all times...
<string>I can feel the power! Raise up<lf>your weapon—now, ATTACK!
<string>Now is the time to retaliate!<lf>FOR KAMURA!
<string>An installation is down...!<lf>It will be fixed momentarily!
<string>Apex sighted. Defeat it, and<lf>this defense will be a success.
<string>The Apex is readying an attack!<lf>Brace yourselves!
<string>What...destructive force!<lf>Truly terrifying!
<string>The Apex's roar riled the horde!
<string>The Apex has destroyed<lf>the Stronghold! The nerve...!
<string>We've only just begun. Compose<lf>yourself and get back up.
<string>Installation effectiveness: Excellent!
<string>Installation effectiveness: Poor...
<string>What bravery—it has spread to<lf>everyone and boosted morale!
<string>Oh my, such strength...<lf>I must strive to match you!
<string>Tremendous work, <PL>!<lf>You hunt like a blazing fire!
<string>Our hope burning bright! Purify Kamura<lf>of this calamity with your fire!
<string><PL>... Good luck!
<string>Leave the vanguard to me!<lf>Everyone! Let's go!
<string>Ibushi, you fiend!<lf>Release my sister from your spell!
<string>No, I won't! I'll never leave<lf>your side, Hinoa!
<string><PL>!<lf>Take care of Ibushi, quickly!
