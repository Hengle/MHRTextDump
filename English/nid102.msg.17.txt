<string>This is the Hub reception area.
<string>I've been waiting for you. As you<lf>could have guessed, all Gathering<lf>Hub quests go through me.
<string>Please be aware these quests<lf>are meant for a party of hunters.
<string>Quests will be rated at 1★, 2★,<lf>and so on. Think of the number<lf>of stars as the level of difficulty.
<string>1★ to 3★ quests are classified<lf>as <COLS RED>low rank</COL>, and 4★ to 7★ are<lf>classified as <COL RED>high rank</COL>.
<string>I'm sure that in no time you will<lf>be taking on high rank quests.<lf>At least, that is what Hinoa says.
<string>Here at the Hub, your <COLS RED>Hunter Rank</COL>,<lf>or <COL RED>HR</COL> for short, determines what<lf>quests you are able to accept.
<string>A Hunter Rank of HR1 allows you<lf>to accept 1★ quests, HR2 lets you<lf>accept 2★, you get the idea.
<string>As for increasing your rank, well,<lf>I'll get into that later. For now,<lf>concentrate on what's in front of you.
<string>Oh, and when you want to participate<lf>in a quest with other hunters...
<string><CAM:1>You can check available quests and their<lf>details from the <COLS RED>Quest Board</COL>.
<string><CAM:2>Once you've accepted a quest,<lf>head to the <COLS RED>Quest Gate</COL> to embark.
<string><FCAM>Oh, I mentioned earlier that<lf>Gathering Hub quests are for a party<lf>of hunters, meaning four hunters.
<string>However, if you are confident in<lf>your abilities, you may attempt<lf>them on your own as well.
<string>Feel free to use the Prep Area<lf>on the second floor. Preparation<lf>is half the battle, after all.
<string>That should be everything.<lf>"Should." I'll check with Hinoa<lf>later to see if I forgot anything.
<string>At any rate, you'll be starting<lf>with <COLS RED>1★</COL> quests. Good luck.
<string>*giggle*<lf>It looks just like Master Hojo...
<string>*ahem* Oh, <PL>!<lf>An urgent quest has come<lf>in for you.
<string>Your target is a <COLS RED>Tetranadon</COL>, a fearsome<lf>amphibian-like monster that will gobble<lf>up anything in its path.
<string>Not only will you need to beware its gaping maw,<lf>but if it does gobble something up, its belly will<lf>swell, and it'll use its mass to try to crush you.
<string>Try not to get slurped up or squashed<lf>out there, Hunter...
<string>Well, then, best of luck!
<string>Good job out there.
<string>Welcome back and well done, <PL>.<lf>You're making impressive progress, though<lf>that's what's expected from a skilled hunter.
<string>Good news. You can now accept <COLS RED>2★</COL> quests,<lf>which allows you to visit two new locales:<lf>The <COL RED>Sandy Plains</COL> and the <COL RED>Flooded Forest</COL>.
<string>Now then, care to browse the Quest List?
<string>I must be prepared.
<string>The Rampage is finally here.<lf>I have an urgent quest for you.
<string>I am to defend the Stronghold with the others.<lf>A pity you won't be able to witness the power<lf>of my lance from within the fortress.
<string>Nonetheless, you will need to accept<lf>the urgent quest from the quest list<lf>before you may depart.
<string>What a relief...
<string>Good work defending against the Rampage,<lf><PL>. Your valiant efforts kept the<lf>village safe through it all.
<string>I fought with all my strength yet<lf>Hinoa ran circles around me...<lf>I must work harder.
<string>There are still some 2★ quests<lf>left for you to accept when you<lf>are ready.
<string>In addition, you are now able to accept<lf>Rampage quests. Consider taking those<lf>on when you want a change of pace.
<string>That is one scary monster...
<string><PL>, an urgent quest<lf>has just come in for you!
<string>Your target for this hunt is the Devourer<lf>of the Rampage, the Wyvern of Malice,<lf><COLS RED>Magnamalo</COL>.
<string>Magnamalo controls a ghostly vapor<lf>we call "hellfire." It uses this vapor in<lf>a variety of attacks, so watch out for it.
<string>Hellfire is a manifestation of<lf>Magnamalo's untempered fury<lf>and signals that its rage is building.
<string>So good luck with that.
<string>Master Hojo is such a worry wart...
<string>It's good to see you, <PL>.<lf>I'm glad you're back in one piece.
<string>Of course, Master Hojo is glad as well.<lf>Despite how far you've come as a hunter,<lf>he worries about you constantly...
<string>I even noticed that he had written:<lf>"I worry about <PL>..."<lf>on one of his illustrations.
<string>And he fidgets incessantly until<lf>you come back... And he won't<lf>leave me alone either! Ugh!
<string>"Is <PL> back yet!?"<lf>"Is <PL> back yet!?"<lf>How would I know from behind this desk!?
<string>But I can understand, I'm the same way with<lf>Hinoa. If she so much as coughs, I'm right<lf>there by her side with hot soup and a blanket!
<string>*ahem* Sorry for the tangent. Anyway,<lf>you're now able to accept <COLS RED>3★</COL> quests.<lf>Let me know when you are ready.
<string>We must protect the Stronghold<lf>until the bitter end...
<string><PL>.<lf>An urgent quest has come in for you.
<string>As part of the defense against<lf>the Rampage, your target is<lf>an <COLS RED>Apex Arzuros</COL>.
<string>An Apex controls a horde of rampaging<lf>monsters and imparts unto those under<lf>its command its own indomitable spirit.
<string>I needn't tell you how dangerous an Apex<lf>can be... But Hinoa has a particularly<lf>bad feeling about this one.
<string>Master Hojo shares her unease. Tread<lf>carefully out there, Hinoa and Master<lf>Hojo are rarely wrong about these things...
<string>Well then, best of luck to you.
<string>Hinoa...
<string><VO:SER>I'm sorry to have worried everyone, I must<lf>apologize for my actions. Seeing Hinoa<lf>like that—I'm...fine. I'm fine.
<string>It's Hinoa you should focus on.<lf>Resonating with that horrible creature<lf>took a serious toll on her body...
<string>She endured so much pain, yet I was<lf>powerless to do anything. Never have<lf>I felt so useless...or so much hatred.
<string><PL>, I beg you.<lf>Track down that infernal creature<lf>and destroy— My apologies...
<string><VO:NOR>I'm letting my feelings interfere with<lf>my duties. *ahem* <PL>, <COLS RED>4★</COL> quests<lf>are now available for you to accept.
<string>Might I remind you 4★ quests are considered<lf><COLS RED>high rank</COL> quests. In addition, high rank<lf>Rampage Quests are now available as well.
<string>This higher tier of quests is a considerable<lf>leap in difficulty and will test you at every<lf>turn. Best of luck to you out there.
<string>Disgusting yuck fish.
<string><PL>.<lf>An urgent quest has come in for you.
<string>Your target this time is<lf>a <COLS RED>Jyuratodus</COL>, a Piscine Wyvern<lf>that lives in swampy environments.
<string>That swampy environment, as you can<lf>imagine, is extremely difficult to navigate.<lf>You'll be fighting it as much the yuckfish.
<string>Best of luck to you out there...and<lf>I ask that you please use the bathing<lf>facilities when you get back.
<string>Invaders...?
<string>Hello, <PL>. I have good news<lf>for you. You are now able to accept <COLS RED>5★</COL> quests.<lf>Please have a look when you have time.
<string>And, one more thing. Be aware that there<lf>is the possibility of monsters invading your<lf>quests now. Don't get caught unaware.
<string>If things become overwhelming, there is no<lf>shame in retreating. That's it. Stay on your<lf>guard out there and best of luck to you.
<string>Such a sudden development...
<string><PL>.<lf>An urgent quest has come in for you.
<string>Your target this time a <COLS RED>Mizutsune</COL> in the<lf>Shrine Ruins. It may appear majestic<lf>and beautiful, but don't be fooled.
<string>These creatures are quite nimble<lf>and use the foam they create to<lf>maneuver and attack.
<string>They normally don't pose any threat to us,<lf>but this particular Mizutsune has become<lf>extremely agitated. I wonder why...
<string>Now then, good luck to you out there.
<string>So that's what the Rampage really is...
<string>Hello, <PL>.<lf>You are now able to accept <COLS RED>6★</COL> quests.<lf>Please have a look when you have time.
<string>Can you believe that the Rampage<lf>is actually a large-scale migration<lf>of monsters!?
<string>I cannot fathom the degree of power<lf>that Wind Serpent Ibushi must wield<lf>to give rise to such an uproar...
<string>In any case, there's not a moment to lose.<lf>We must quell the Rampage and put an<lf>end to the pain that my sister is enduring.
<string>Hinoa...
<string>An urgent quest has come in for you.
<string><PL>...<lf>The time has finally come<lf>to slay <COLS RED>Wind Serpent Ibushi</COL>!
<string><VO:SER>Though my sister is putting on<lf>a brave face for the village,<lf>deep down she is suffering.
<string>If only I had her power, I would gladly<lf>take her place. Ugh! Why am I so—<lf>Forgive me. *ahem*
<string><PL>...<lf>I beg you. Please. Please, save<lf>the Village. Save my sister!
<string>What a relief...
<string>You did it! You freed my sister<lf>from her resonance with that<lf>horrid creature!
<string>I'm selfish, I apologize. The Rampage<lf>is still very much a threat, but all I can<lf>think about is my sister.
<string>I cannot thank you enough.
<string>There are no new quests at the moment.<lf>If you wish to increase your HR further,<lf>please continue with 6★ quests.
<string>......
<string><VO:SER>......
<string>Hey there, <PL>!<lf>Guess what just came in for you?<lf>That's right, an Urgent Quest! Woo!
<string>Uh...
<string>What?<lf>Something seems "off" about me?
<string>Ha! I know it looks that way, but...
<string>How do I explain it? Hmm...<lf>Yeah, I definitely don't feel like myself.<lf>Maybe it's exhaustion. Who knows?
<string>A short rest and I'll be back to my<lf>ol' serious-pants self. I'll be fine.<lf>Now back to this urgent quest biz...
<string>And that biz is hunting a <COLS RED>Rakna-Kadaki</COL>!<lf>It bobs. It weaves. It's here. It's there.<lf>And then suddenly fire everywhere.
<string>Did you get all that? I hope<lf>so 'cause I'm not repeating it!<lf>Good luck out there!
<string>So this is resonance...
<string>What's wrong, <PL>?<lf>You've quite the long face today.
<string>Huh? Are you worried about<lf>me resonating with Thunder<lf>Serpent Narwa?
<string>I appreciate your concern. It was the<lf>first time I'd experienced it, so I apologize<lf>for my reaction, but you needn't worry.
<string>The constant stream of thoughts can be<lf>distracting, but I forget about it because<lf>I'm so glad to have the same power as Hinoa.
<string>Enough about me. I have new quests<lf>for you. You are now able to accept <COLS RED>7★</COL><lf>quests. Have a look when you are ready.
<string>I have almost pin-pointed Thunder<lf>Serpent Narwa's location using our<lf>connection. We will surely find it soon.
<string>I wish you luck.
<string><PL>.<lf>The time has finally come.
<string>I won't say much. Everyone in the<lf>village has already said everything<lf>I would have said and said it better...
<string>You are the pride of Kamura Village.<lf>You have the courage to confront<lf>the calamity.
<string>And an irreplaceable member of our family...
<string>I will be waiting for your return right here.
<string>It's only just begun...
<string><NOFAC>Ibushi and Narwa both still<lf>draw breath, I'm sure of it...<lf>The Rampage isn't over yet.
<string>But you helped to uncover the true<lf>source of the calamity that has plagued,<lf>us and show us the light of hope.
<string>Soon, the time will come for you to confront<lf>them yourself. To leap into the maw of<lf>calamity and purge its source...
<string>But I'm getting ahead of myself.<lf>For now, please just try to relax.
<string>You've been constantly thrown into perilous<lf>danger, all for the sake of Kamura, and<lf>never shown a hint of faltering.
<string>Everyone in the village is worried<lf>that you might need a bit of a break...<lf>Including me, of course.
<string>So why not recharge your batteries<lf>before the next hunt? You know what<lf>they say: "Haste makes waste."
<string>Strive for greatness...
<string>I've been waiting for you, <PL>.
<string>I've just heard from the Hunter's Guild.
<string>You've <COL RED>unlocked your HR</COL>.<lf>Congratulations!
<string>And it'll keep increasing the more you<lf>accomplish out in the field.
<string>That's what'll prove your abilities as<lf>a hunter. The higher your rank, the more<lf>challenging the quests you'll get to tackle.
<string>Ibushi and Narwa may have turned tail for<lf>now, but only so that they can soon return<lf>at full strength, in all their former glory.
<string>They will surely show themselves<lf>in due time. Until then, it's vital that<lf>you keep your skills sharp.
<string>Both Hinoa and I have full confidence<lf>in your abilities, <PL>.<lf>Continue to strive for greatness.
<string>Now then, why not take a look<lf>at the quest list?
<string>A mysterious wyvern...
<string><PL>, an urgent quest has come in.
<string>Just so you're aware, completing<lf>this urgent quest unlocks <COLS RED>HR 20</COL><lf>for you.
<string>Meaning: Your HR won't increase<lf>any more until you complete it.
<string>The target is an elder dragon:<lf>a <COLS RED>Chameleos</COL>.
<string>It's known for its uncanny<lf>ability to vanish into thin air...<lf>Well, hazy air.
<string>Be careful out there and<lf>watch your Item Pouch.
<string>Well, then, good luck.
<string>Well done.
<string><NOFAC>Welcome back, <PL>.<lf>Slaying that Chameleos couldn't<lf>have been easy.
<string>Um, by the way...<lf>D-Did it REALLY look like<lf>Master Hojo's illustration?
<string>I'm sorry, it's just—I haven't read up<lf>on the creature as much as I'd like, and<lf>I haven't had the chance to see one either.
<string>It's such a weird-looking creature,<lf>it's hard to believe that such<lf>a thing actually exists and—
<string>*ahem* Sorry for my tangent, Hunter.
<string>With the completion of this quest,<lf>you've unlocked <COLS RED>HR 20</COL>. Keep up<lf>the good work, <PL>!
<string>The Frost Islands...
<string><PL>, we have<lf>an urgent quest for you.
<string>Just so you're aware, completing<lf>this urgent quest unlocks <COLS RED>HR 30</COL><lf>for you.
<string>Your target is a <COLS RED>Kushala Daora</COL>,<lf>an elder dragon with metallic<lf>scales that can manipulate wind.
<string>It will attack you with cyclones or<lf>use them to form defensive barriers.<lf>Study its patterns to find an opening!
<string>Well, then, best of luck!
<string>Welcome back.
<string><NOFAC>That Kushala Daora was no<lf>match for you! Good work!
<string>You know, seeing you achieve extraordinary<lf>victories like that makes me realize I have<lf>to put more effort into my own training.
<string>I'm not the only one either.<lf>You've sparked a fire in the<lf>hearts of everyone in Kamura.
<string>Anyway, enough of the mushy stuff.<lf>With the completion of this quest, you've<lf>unlocked <COLS RED>HR 30</COL>. Keep up the good work!
<string>Almost regal...
<string>Oh, hello, <PL>.<lf>An urgent quest has just come in.
<string>Just so you're aware, completing<lf>this urgent quest unlocks <COLS RED>HR 40</COL><lf>for you.
<string>Your target is a <COLS RED>Teostra</COL>. An elder<lf>dragon that cloaks itself in flame...
<string>And when enraged, it unleashes<lf>an explosively devastating attack<lf>known as "supernova."
<string>Please be especially mindful of this<lf>attack—it's not something you can<lf>shrug off with a potion or two.
<string>Well, then, good luck to you.
<string>Great job.
<string><NOFAC>One after another, you continue<lf>to best these fabled elder dragons...<lf>Your skills really are impressive.
<string>Whenever I tell Hinoa about your hunting<lf>exploits, her face lights up with a gleaming<lf>smile as bright as the sun itself...
<string>So keep at it—aim to be the paragon<lf>of hunters, so Hinoa can keep smiling<lf>as brightly as she does now.
<string>But, that isn't to say Hinoa is the only<lf>one happy to see your accomplishments;<lf>of course, I am as well.
<string>Speaking of, with the completion<lf>of this quest, you've unlocked <COLS RED>HR 40</COL>.<lf>Keep up the good work.
<string>The time has finally come...
<string><PL>, it's finally here.
<string>...Oh my, how many quests<lf>have I sent you out on now?<lf>Quite a few, no doubt.
<string>I might've been slightly concerned at first,<lf>but quest by quest, you've proved yourself<lf>to be something far greater than capable.
<string>You're somebody the whole village believes<lf>in. That's why I'm not worried—with you here,<lf>what reason could I possibly have to be?
<string>You'll return in high spirits<lf>as you always do. I know<lf>you will.
<string>...Best of luck to you.
<string>The calm after the storm...
<string><NOFAC><PL>... Thanks to your efforts,<lf>all the nearby monsters seem to<lf>be calming down at long last.
<string>I suppose we could call you:<lf>"<PL>, Savior of Kamura."
<string>...And, um, if we did, it would be most<lf>savior-ly of you to forget about my, uh...<lf>"vocal stomach" the other day...
<string>I can't wait to see where<lf>your hunts take you next!
<string>A Crimson Glow...?
<string><PL>!<lf>Kamura is under threat yet again!
<string>The menace this time is...<lf>A <COLS RED>Valstrax</COL>!
<string>Valstrax is a fearsome elder dragon<lf>that shows up under many ominous<lf>names in literature of yore.
<string>This one is slightly unusual though.<lf>It emits a sinister and bewitching light...
<string>And this eerie red gleam<lf>earns it an added epithet:<lf>The "<COLS RED>Crimson Glow</COL>."
<string>Still, no matter how dangerous<lf>it might be, I know we can count<lf>on you to take it out.
<string>From me, my sister, and<lf>everyone else who calls<lf>this village home:
<string>May you have the best of luck.
<string>Welcome back!
<string><NOFAC>Amazing, <PL>...!<lf>You took down that Valstrax<lf>with such skill!
<string>Hehe... Oh! Sorry. I couldn't help<lf>but smile, since you came back safe...
<string>And honestly, seeing your bravery<lf>never fails to bring warmth to my heart.
<string>The tranquil flame watching over Kamura...<lf>That's what you'll always be to me.
<string>And I'll always be ready to aid you in your<lf>efforts with everything I've got.
<string>So, where will you be off to next?
<string><NOFAC><FCAM>Report the Rampage to the Guild...<lf>Sort hunter application requirements...<lf>Update quest list...
<string>...<PL>, it won't be<lf>very exciting for you to watch<lf>me—this goes here—work.
<string>I'm not as good at my job as<lf>Hinoa is, so I will need a little<lf>more time.
<string>I'm sorry to trouble you, but could<lf>you go and ask Hinoa to explain<lf>the quest details to you?
<string>Because of the Rampage, our workload<lf>has grown precipitously. It's calmed down<lf>a bit now, though, so you may relax.
<string>You're going to be quite busy from now<lf>on, <PL>. There are always hunts,<lf>but Rampage defense is important too.
<string>And might I remind you to please<lf>make good use of the items and<lf>weapons that Hinoa gave you.
<string>As you know, Gathering Hub<lf>quests are intended for a party<lf>of hunters.
<string>The quests that Hinoa offers can only<lf>be attempted solo. I recommend trying<lf>a variety of quests to gain experience.
<string><PL>.<lf>An urgent quest has come in for you.<lf>Your target is a Tetranadon.
<string>Forgive me... I can't help but<lf>to compare it to Master Hojo.<lf>T-Tell me you see it too!
<string>*ahem* Anyway, Tetranadon will use<lf>its size against you. So watch yourself.<lf>A pancaked hunter is no good to us!
<string><PL>, the Rampage<lf>is finally upon us.
<string>While you're stationed inside,<lf>we will defend the perimeter.
<string>If they break through our defenses,<lf>Kamura will be in grave danger.<lf>We're counting on you!
<string>Excellent work defending the Stronghold,<lf><PL>.
<string>Master Hojo is waiting for your report.
<string>The most important thing is that<lf>everyone survived the Rampage.
<string>We used every ounce of our strength to<lf>defend the village perimeter, but there<lf>were too many, and we were overrun.
<string>In the future, we must work harder<lf>not to place such a heavy burden<lf>on your shoulders alone.
<string>However, for the time being, we have<lf>no choice but to rely on your strength,<lf>even though it pains me to ask that.
<string>Excellent work hunting<lf>that Tetranadon. Hardly<lf>a challenge for you at all...
<string>Master Hojo is waiting for your report.
<string>The blistering heat of the Sandy Plains,<lf>or the humidity of the Flooded Forest...<lf>2★ quests will challenge you in new ways.
<string>I'm not the type to head outside if<lf>I don't have to, so I would have to<lf>prepare myself mentally for such a task.
<string>Which is why I'm perfectly<lf>fine staying inside.
<string>The urgent quest to face<lf>Magnamalo has arrived.
<string>It is known as the Devourer<lf>of the Rampage. It's a vicious<lf>beast. Do be careful, please.
<string>Good work on taking down Magnamalo!
<string>Master Hojo is waiting for your report.
<string>The threat of the Rampage still looms,<lf>yet having a warrior like you around<lf>gives the village courage.
<string>Hinoa was so proud of your achievements,<lf>you would think they were her own...<lf>She wouldn't shut up about them!
<string>I must admit, I'm a little jealous.<lf>I doubt she would ever talk about<lf>me like that...
<string>This horde of rampaging monsters<lf>is led by a rabid Apex Arzuros.
<string>Dispatch the leader, and those under<lf>its influence will surely scatter.
<string><VO:SER>Please be careful though. Hinoa and<lf>Master Hojo both have a bad feeling<lf>about this.
<string><VO:SER>Hinoa is suffering, and I'm stuck<lf>here being useless... All I can do<lf>for her is to stay by her side.
<string>If only I had the same power<lf>that she does, maybe I could<lf>take her place...
<string>She is my sister... My twin!<lf>Why am I so much weaker<lf>than her!?
<string>I beg you, <PL>...<lf>Please, track down that wicked<lf>beast that hurt Hinoa and destroy it!
<string><PL>, please take<lf>care of the urgent quest to hunt a<lf>Jyuratodus as soon as possible.
<string>This monster excels at attacking from<lf>beneath the mud. If you get stuck in it,<lf>it's sure to notice.
<string>Please be careful.
<string>Welcome back, <PL>.<lf>Thank you for taking out that<lf>disgusting thing. Ew.
<string>Master Hojo is waiting for your report.
<string>That blue elder dragon was<lf>spotted in the Flooded Forest!?
<string>What a creepy monster. What<lf>drives it to wander around here?
<string>Please! There's no time to waste!<lf>You must slay that fiend to put an<lf>end to the pain Hinoa is enduring.
<string><PL>. An urgent quest<lf>has arrived. You need to hunt<lf>down a Mizutsune.
<string>The Mizutsune in the Shrine<lf>Ruins are usually rather meek.<lf>We generally pay them no mind...
<string>However, it suddenly turned hyper<lf>aggressive. Everyone is rather curious,<lf>myself included, why this happened.
<string>Mizutsune are nimble creatures. They have<lf>an array of bubble attacks that can be<lf>tricky to gauge. Be careful out there.
<string>Everyone thought that the Rampage<lf>was just a horde of monsters that<lf>attacked the village.
<string>But to find out that this mass movement<lf>of monsters was triggered by Wind<lf>Serpent Ibushi's presence...
<string>The power that such a beast must<lf>possess to influence that many<lf>monsters at a time...
<string>Nevertheless, I must ask that you<lf>hunt it down! Hunt it down so Hinoa<lf>will be free of pain she's enduring!
<string>Finally, Wind Serpent Ibushi has<lf>shown itself. It approaches, the<lf>Rampage a harbinger of its presence.
<string>Its approach is causing Hinoa<lf>to resonate again. She's in<lf>terrible agony.
<string>I will do whatever's in my power to<lf>draw that loathsome creature away<lf>from the Rampage!
<string>Please, <PL>...<lf>Please save my sister!
<string>You repelled Wind Serpent Ibushi and<lf>freed Hinoa from their involuntary<lf>resonance. I cannot thank you enough.
<string>Now I finally understand what my<lf>sister saw in you, <PL>.
<string>The fire of kindness in you lights the<lf>way for us all. It is a warrior's spirit<lf>burning bright, no matter the obstacle.
<string>You are our light. And you have my<lf>utmost respect and appreciation.
<string>The memory of the Rampage<lf>is still fresh in my mind, but<lf>for now, I can rest easy.
<string>The next time the village faces<lf>the Rampage, or another threat<lf>like it... I know that we will triumph!
<string>The only thing I'm afraid of is Hinoa<lf>getting hurt. Monsters? I'll smite<lf>them down with a thrust of my lance!
<string><VO:SER>What are you waiting for?<lf>Your target is the Rakna-Kadaki<lf>hiding in the Lava Caverns.
<string>Woo boy, I'm pooped!<lf>I feel like I'm starting to hear voices...
<string>Once you depart for the quest, I'll go<lf>and have some rest, preferably with<lf>my head in Hinoa's lap...
<string>Go now. Shoo! Don't worry<lf>about me. Just a little...tired.<lf>Tired...
<string>I thought only Hinoa possessed this<lf>power, but I found it within me, too.
<string>I was always worried that we weren't<lf>really sisters... But now that I have<lf>this power, there's no doubt.
<string>The constant stream of thoughts from<lf>Narwa is a little annoying, but I'm too<lf>happy to notice it much.
<string>And Hinoa is so worried, she's always<lf>coming to visit me. She won't even<lf>leave my side when we're at home...
<string><PL>, you don't really<lf>need to slay the Thunder Serpent, right!?<lf>You can just forget all about it...
<string>...I'm kidding, I'm kidding.<lf>(Please don't tell anyone I said that.)
<string>Thunder Serpent Narwa's thoughts<lf>are incredibly potent. They've allowed<lf>me to get a rough grasp of where she is.
<string>"Where is my king? Where is my king?"<lf>That thought just keeps repeating—<lf>A maddening repetition, just like Ibushi...
<string>But whereas Ibushi's thoughts were<lf>shrouded in frantic isolation, Narwa's<lf>are full of ire...
<string>This leads me to believe that its<lf>power far surpasses Ibushi's. We<lf>must be cautious in our search.
<string>We finally made it. We couldn't have<lf>done it without you, <PL>.
<string>If you defeat Narwa, Kamura Village<lf>will be delivered from the Rampage<lf>that has plagued us for so long.
<string>I will be waiting for your return<lf>right here...
<string>Take care out there. Please,<lf>make sure you return, no matter<lf>what happens.
<string>The Rampage isn't over yet...<lf>The calamity will continue<lf>for a while.
<string>Wind Serpent Ibushi and Thunder<lf>Serpent Narwa both survived.<lf>They will try to reunite again...
<string>We can sense them through our<lf>resonance, as clear as day. We<lf>have to stop them, at any cost!
<string><PL>, we will do everything<lf>we can to help you.
<string>Next time, we'll find those foul<lf>creatures and put an end to<lf>them once and for all.
<string>You're a true warrior. There's no way<lf>you won't triumph over Wind Serpent<lf>Ibushi and Thunder Serpent Narwa.
<string>I needn't worry—I'll just calmly<lf>await your return, like I always do.
<string>Well then... Best of luck to you.
<string>You brought the Rampage to its ultimate<lf>conclusion—it's phenomenal. You really<lf>are the Savior of Kamura, <PL>.
<string>But that doesn't mean your hunts<lf>are over; your tale as a hunter has<lf>only just begun.
<string>And wherever it takes you, Hinoa<lf>and I will always be cheering you on.
<string>As the Rampage's presence dwindles<lf>day by day, it's as if my sister's smile<lf>keeps growing brighter and brighter...
<string>And with her health and happiness<lf>recovered, I have nothing more to<lf>worry—
<string>*ahem* Sorry for my tangents...<lf>So, <PL>! Savior of Kamura,<lf>which quest will you be taking on today?
<string>Master Hojo illustrates all<lf>of the monsters on the<lf>Quest Board.
<string>I always hear him yell, "THAT'S IT!"<lf>And with a flurry of brushstrokes<lf>the most amazing picture appears.
<string>I'm excited to see his brilliant<lf>work, but how can he whip up such<lf>masterpieces so effortlessly!?
<string>Some time ago, I picked up painting.<lf>Being around Master Hojo all day<lf>has rubbed off on me, I suppose.
<string>But it's really frustrating. No matter<lf>how hard I try to make something<lf>I'm satisfied with, I...just can't.
<string>I don't need to be good at everything,<lf>like Hinoa. But I just wish I was at<lf>least good at ONE thing...
<string>Hinoa often says she's the<lf>type that gets bored easily,<lf>but I wouldn't say that at all.
<string>My sister is a genius. No matter how<lf>hard something is, she figures it out<lf>right away, and masters it in no time.
<string>So, she runs out of things to do... She<lf>calls that "getting bored," but really,<lf>there's just nothing more she can learn.
<string>Hinoa often buys dango at Yomogi's<lf>place, but the ones here in the Hub<lf>are pretty good too.
<string>The dango that Otemai the Chef<lf>makes have a more complex flavor.<lf>You can tell they were made by a pro.
<string>I buy different ones depending<lf>on my mood. Which dango<lf>do you prefer, <PL>?
<string><VO:SER>Sometimes, I wish I was<lf>little bit more like Hinoa.<lf>I don't want to be her, but...
<string>I beg you, <PL>...<lf>Please, track down that wicked<lf>beast that hurt Hinoa and destroy it!
<string>Recently, I went to the Buddy Plaza,<lf>and all the Canynes wagged their tales<lf>at Hinoa and just growled at me...
<string>We may look alike... But sometimes,<lf>I don't feel worthy of being Hinoa's<lf>sister at all.
<string>People often ask me, "Is it OK for Hinoa<lf>to be eating all of those Bunny Dango?"<lf>They really think that's all she eats!
<string>Of course, I cannot blame them. Every time<lf>I step out of the Hub for some fresh air, she's<lf>got one in her mouth and another in her hand!
<string>But don't worry, I do my best to<lf>make sure she eats plenty of greens<lf>at home. And NOT green dango. Hehe.
<string>I'm not good at a lot of things but I<lf>have learned to cook and do other<lf>chores around the house.
<string>In fact, I'd gladly clean your room for<lf>you, if that's OK. I'm guessing it<lf>hasn't seen a broom in a while.
<string>Some people have told me they're<lf>worried that sitting down all day<lf>isn't good for me.
<string>I try to get up and stretch every so<lf>often, but this line of work can<lf>certainly get you out of shape.
<string>Don't tell Elder Fugen or Master Utsushi<lf>that. They'll have me running laps around<lf>the village before you can say "dango."
<string>Just keep that to yourself, OK?
<string>You know, it's odd. Now that I'm<lf>experiencing resonance with Narwa for<lf>the second time, I'm quite used to it.
<string>Hinoa, too, seems not to notice her<lf>resonance with Ibushi at all anymore,<lf>like it's just any other day.
<string>Of course, if we don't get rid of them,<lf>our village is doomed... We must find<lf>them as soon as possible.
<string><PL>, through completing<lf>so many quests, you have become<lf>a prestigious hunter.
<string>Your name shall echo across the land,<lf>and perhaps, within due time, other<lf>villages and towns may ask for your aid.
<string>It's your life, so I can't tell you what to do...
<string>But... If you wouldn't mind it...<lf>Could you maybe stay in<lf>Kamura forever?
<string>Everyone would miss you terribly<lf>if you left... Myself included.
