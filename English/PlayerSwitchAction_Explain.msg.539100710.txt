<string>A shoulder thrust that withstands all attacks.<lf><lf>Prevents knockbacks as well as getting<lf>knocked down, making it useful for standing<lf>your ground while charging.
<string>A forward-dashing attack using<lf>the flat side of the blade. More<lf>cumbersome than your standard<lf>tackle, but strong and allows you<lf>to guard.<lf><lf>A successful Guard can be followed<lf>up with a powerful Charged Attack.
<string>A daring aerial attack, using a Wirebug<lf>to fly up for a hefty Roundslash.<lf>If the attack connects, the hunter<lf>bounces upward and transitions directly<lf>into the next Charged Slash attack,<lf>forming the crux of this attack.<lf><lf>(Wirebug Gauge recovery speed: Fast)
<string>A technique using a Wirebug to dash<lf>forward, and deliver a Strong Charged<lf>Slash. Also allows you to withstand<lf>knockdown attacks by hardening your<lf>body as you dash forth.<lf><lf>(Wirebug Gauge recovery speed: Medium)
<string>A devastating Charged Slash attack<lf>delivering extensive damage, striking<lf>twice by making a large swing with<lf>the weapon.<lf><lf>By striking the monster's softer weak<lf>spot with the first strike, the second<lf>strike deals additional damage.
<string>A strike from a unique stance.<lf><lf>While it does not match the power<lf>of a True Charged Slash, receiving<lf>damage while the weapon is drawn<lf>sparks a flame in the user's heart,<lf>strengthening their attack.
<string>A top-down slash while moving forward.<lf><lf>The blade takes a vertical path, making<lf>it a useful technique when aiming up<lf>high.
<string>A drawn attack that unleashes<lf>a vertical then horizontal slash.<lf><lf>As you move forward, you're able<lf>to absorb a hit while attacking.<lf>Although it deals more damage than<lf>a Step Slash, there are few attacks<lf>that you can use to follow up. Use<lf>at your discretion.
<string>A quick Wirebug-induced jump kick.<lf>A missed kick ends the attack with a<lf>single slash, while a successful kick<lf>can be followed with one of two moves.<lf><lf>The Plunging Thrust increases Spirit<lf>Gauge, while the Spirit Helm Breaker<lf>reduces the Spirit Gauge by one level.<lf>(Wirebug Gauge recovery speed: Medium)
<string>A whirlwind-like attack, dashing and<lf>slicing past the target with a Wirebug.<lf><lf>The hit causes multiple lacerations<lf>over time, inducing additional damage.<lf><lf>The hit raises the Spirit Gauge by 1.<lf><lf>(Wirebug Gauge recovery speed: Slow)

<string>A move made to exceed one's limits.<lf><lf>While active, your stamina gradually<lf>decreases while your attack and evasion<lf>change, resisting any knockback.<lf><lf>Movement speed increases dramatically,<lf>allowing you to roam the field like a<lf>force of nature.
<string>A move beyond the limits of any other.<lf><lf>When active, your stamina gradually<lf>decreases while your attack and evasion<lf>change, resisting any knockback.<lf><lf>You switch to an attack-focused stance,<lf>dealing slashing attacks when dodging.
<string>An attack that drives a blade bound by<lf>Ironsilk into the target like a stake. The<lf>blade remains connected to the hunter<lf>by Ironsilk, dealing additional slash damage<lf>to the same spot every time you attack.<lf>The added damage accumulates over time,<lf>eventually unleashing massive damage.<lf><lf>(Wirebug Gauge recovery speed: Slow)
<string>Launches a Wirebug upwards and you<lf>with it.<lf><lf>This action does not do any damage,<lf>but allows you to move through the air<lf>in most cases, even with your weapon<lf>drawn.<lf><lf>(Wirebug Gauge recovery speed: Fast)
<string>A side swipe with the hammer.<lf><lf>Can be used as a starting point for<lf>a Big Bang combo.
<string>An attack that allows you to absorb<lf>a monster's hit.<lf><lf>Perform this attack right as you're<lf>about to be hit to negate the damage.<lf>When successful, it is possible to follow<lf>up with an upswing hammer attack.
<string>A spinning attack using a Wirebug.<lf><lf>It moves along an arc pattern much like<lf>midair spinning attacks performed on<lf>a slope, but is just as effective on<lf>flat terrain.<lf><lf>(Wirebug Gauge recovery speed: Fast)
<string>An attack performed by rushing forward<lf>with the help of a Wirebug.<lf><lf>A simple skill evoking the philosophy<lf>of "beelining and then smashing."<lf>Enemy attacks won't cause knock-<lf>back while launching forward.<lf><lf>(Wirebug Gauge recovery speed: Fast)
<string>A special action affecting charge<lf>attacks.<lf><lf>Lengthens required charge time, but<lf>allows for more powerful actions.
<string>A special action that affects charge<lf>attacks.<lf><lf>It decreases charging levels, but<lf>allows you to follow from one<lf>charge into another more quickly.
<string>A mighty attack that swings the hunting<lf>horn down from above.<lf><lf>Effective in reducing the target's stamina.

<string>Changes the way melodies are<lf>played.<lf><lf>Two attacks of the same note in<lf>a row generates the melody effect.<lf>Using <OPT Blader_ZR> plays the "Self-improvement"<lf>song.<lf><lf>A mode focused on being aggressive.
<string>Changes the way melodies are<lf>played.<lf><lf>Press <OPT Blader_ZR> to play all melody effects<lf>built up on the musical staff as well<lf>as the "Self-improvement" song.<lf><lf>A mode useful for applying various<lf>melody effects at once.
<string>Places a Wirebug cocoon on the ground.<lf><lf>If the same hunter generates melody<lf>effects, the effect also appears around<lf>the cocoon, as does as a Sonic Wave that<lf>damages monsters near it.<lf><lf>(Wirebug Gauge recovery speed: Medium)
<string>An attack that drives an Ironsilk-bound<lf>blade into the target like a stake.<lf><lf>When it hits, the Wirebug and weapon<lf>are connected with silk. The vibrations<lf>of the weapon's sonic blast explode<lf>inside the target.<lf><lf>(Wirebug Gauge recovery speed: Medium)
<string>A defensive skill requiring a shield<lf>and some patience.<lf><lf>The technique is to efficiently brace<lf>and absorb the power of the incoming<lf>attack—a high-risk move, but the more<lf>powerful the attack you absorb, the more<lf>your attack power will increase.<lf>(Wirebug Gauge recovery speed: Medium)
<string>A lightning-fast, two-step maneuver to<lf>reposition and counterattack.<lf><lf>This attack uses your shield to parry,<lf>then uses a Wirebug to send you<lf>thrusting forward. Use it to confuse your<lf>target and unleash a wave of strikes.<lf><lf>(Wirebug Gauge recovery speed: Medium)
<string>A charging attack using the lance.<lf><lf>You can continue to speed up for<lf>a certain amount of time by gaining<lf>momentum.<lf><lf>The charge attack continues until<lf>you choose to cancel it, have no more<lf>stamina, or crash into a wall.
<string>A charging attack with the shield up.<lf><lf>You can dash for a limited amount<lf>of time while fending off attacks with<lf>the shield.<lf><lf>Crashing into a monster will cause<lf>shield-based blunt damage, making<lf>it an offensive and defensive skill.
<string>Ready your shield to block attacks.<lf><lf>A large shield can defend against<lf>many an assault.
<string>Swing the shield in an arching motion<lf>to parry attacks. This action works if<lf>an attack is blocked at the start of the<lf>guard move. Failing will leave you open<lf>to attacks, but succeeding can deflect<lf>the most powerful attack without being<lf>hit, and lets you follow up with a Cross<lf>Slash. Great for countering right after<lf>blocking.
<string>A shelling attack that utilizes residual<lf>heat.<lf><lf>Unleashes a fortified shot, though this<lf>requires extra time to perform.
<string>An action that uses recoil to travel.<lf><lf>By aiming the Gunlance backwards, the<lf>hunter is launched forward to<lf>quickly close in on the target.<lf><lf>It is also possible to fire or perform<lf>a Blast Dash again while hurtling.
<string>Uses a Wirebug to launch you upwards<lf>performing a Rising Slash on the way up<lf>and an Overhead Smash on the way down.<lf><lf>You can reload in midair, which reduces<lf>the cooldown time for Wyvern's Fire.<lf><lf>(Wirebug Gauge recovery speed: Fast)
<string>Uses a Wirebug to move forward and<lf>jump into a vigorous upward slash.<lf><lf>Scraping the gunlance on the ground<lf>heats up the barrel, temporarily<lf>increasing the damage dealt by shells,<lf>Wyrmstake Shots, and Wyvern's Fire.<lf><lf>(Wirebug Gauge recovery speed: Slow)
<string>An action for shell reloads.<lf><lf>Allows for quicker shell reloading after<lf>an attack. While it reloads shells to<lf>max capacity, it does not reload<lf>Wyrmstake Shots.
<string>Reload while guarding with your shield.<lf><lf>A highly effective skill that lets you<lf>reload both shells and the Wyrmstake,<lf>but reloads fewer rounds at once.<lf><lf>The difference in rounds reloaded is<lf>negligible if using Gunlances with<lf>smaller capacity.
<string>Thrusts the axe's blade forward while<lf>stepping.<lf><lf>Doesn't do a lot of damage, but is<lf>versatile.
<string>A lunging attack performed by winding<lf>up the axe and smashing it down.<lf><lf>Difficult to pull off but delivers good<lf>damage. A subsequent Sword Mode<lf>attack will turn into a Double Slash.
<string>A finishing blow for the Element Discharge<lf>attack.<lf><lf>Performs a thrust attack while fortifying<lf>elemental energy, ending with a massive<lf>explosion.<lf>If your Amp Gauge is full and the target<lf>is a large monster, the action becomes<lf>a Zero Sum Discharge Finisher.
<string>A finishing blow for the Element Discharge<lf>attack.<lf><lf>Puts you into a knockback-resistant<lf>stance and delivers a swift strike<lf>accompanied by an elemental explosion.<lf><lf>The Amp Gauge has no effect on<lf>this action.
<string>A technique using a Wirebug to surge<lf>forward and dish out three strikes.<lf><lf>You will be impervious to knockdowns<lf>until the strikes are completed, making<lf>this attack useful in a slugfest or pinch.<lf><lf>(Wirebug Gauge recovery speed: Medium)
<string>Uses a Wirebug to fly up while slashing,<lf>ending with an Advancing Slash from midair.<lf><lf>If the Advancing Slash is successful,<lf>the weapon's Amp Gauge fills up,<lf>a large explosion goes off where<lf>it connected.<lf><lf>(Wirebug Gauge recovery speed: Medium)
<string>While charging, elemental energy gathers<lf>on the sword to strengthen it and generate<lf>a powerful bash effect.<lf><lf>The damage dealt by the sword tempo-<lf>rarily increases, and incurs additional<lf>damage. Reinforcing the sword with<lf>this skill, however, requires the shield<lf>to also be elementally boosted.
<string>Activates the Element Regeneration<lf>system while charging. The shield<lf>rotates and acts as a spinning saw blade.<lf><lf>This technique switches the weapon<lf>into Axe Mode, allowing multiple hits<lf>until the mode is disengaged. Longer<lf>hits in Axe Mode turn the energy into<lf>phials.
<string>Sword to axe, axe to sword. This<lf>switching attack forms the basis<lf>of a Charge Blade.<lf><lf>Right as the weapon begins switching<lf>to an axe, or right as it is about to<lf>finish switching to a sword, the shield<lf>is raised to block incoming attacks.
<string>A defense-focused switching attack<lf>with a longer blocking effect.<lf><lf>The weapon can block attacks as it's<lf>switching to either Axe or Sword Mode.<lf><lf>If an attack is successfully blocked<lf>during the switch, the follow-up Element<lf>Discharge Slash's damage increases.
<string>A Guard technique using Wirebug silk.<lf><lf>If an attack is successfully blocked,<lf>phials are filled, and you can lead<lf>into various attack-focused actions.<lf><lf>(Wirebug Gauge recovery speed: Medium)
<string>Slam the axe overhead, using recoil<lf>and Ironsilk to propel you up into the air.<lf><lf>While going upwards, you can unleash<lf>a powerful Element Discharge.<lf><lf>(Wirebug Gauge recovery speed: Medium)
<string>A downward slash technique performed<lf>while lunging forward.<lf><lf>This attack can negate knockbacks<lf>without Orange Extracts.<lf><lf>A versatile skill that can reach higher<lf>areas with its attack.
<string>An attack performed by spinning<lf>forward like a top.<lf><lf>When attacked during the spin,<lf>you will use that force to jump up.<lf><lf>Note: This only happens while you<lf>still have momentum.
<string>A hefty slash performed after a<lf>bludgeoning attack, using the<lf>entire body to swing the weapon.<lf><lf>The second strike is particularly<lf>powerful while remaining versatile.
<string>An attack that delivers four<lf>concentrated strikes.<lf><lf>One of these strikes will mark<lf>the monster, which will attract<lf>Powder Type Kinsects.
<string>An emergency evasion performed<lf>with a Wirebug that recalls your<lf>Kinsect. Upon activation, it will<lf>perform a spinning attack that can<lf>gather a healing extract. Once it<lf>returns, its stamina will fully recover.<lf><lf>(Wirebug Gauge recovery speed: Medium)
<string>A devastating dive attack that uses<lf>a Wirebug to pull you downward with<lf>great force.<lf><lf>The attack has a small damage radius,<lf>but that means the damage is highly<lf>focused.<lf><lf>(Wirebug Gauge recovery speed: Medium)
<string>Executes a reload.<lf><lf>Reload speed depends on ammo<lf>type and the weapon's capabilities.
<string>Reloads shots using a special mechanism.<lf><lf>Its reload speed is somewhat slower than<lf>the standard, but it increases the damage<lf>output of elemental shots.
<string>An evasive maneuver that you can<lf>perform when your weapon is drawn.<lf><lf>As gunners are more likely to be<lf>in danger from being hit, evasive<lf>maneuvers to keep distance from<lf>their target is important.
<string>A quickstep evasive maneuver that<lf>you can perform when your weapon<lf>is drawn.<lf><lf>The distance covered is much smaller<lf>than the standard evade, but requires<lf>less time to recover. Ammo fired<lf>immediately after executing this move<lf>does increased damage.
<string>A jumping action using Wirebugs.<lf>Shots can be fired while in midair.<lf><lf>While airborne, you can fire<lf>Wyvernblasts directly underneath<lf>to land a direct hit on a monster.<lf><lf>(Wirebug Gauge recovery speed: Fast)
<string>A maneuver using a Wirebug and<lf>centrifugal force to quickly flank left<lf>or right. Also temporarily ups attack<lf>power.<lf><lf>Shots can be fired while in motion.<lf>(Wirebug Gauge recovery speed: Fast)
<string>A bludgeoning attack delivered by<lf>directly smashing with the weapon.<lf><lf>Delivers impressive damage, and<lf>may even stun your target. If a<lf>shield is equipped, incoming<lf>attacks can be blocked while<lf>executing your attack.
<string>A shoulder check with robust<lf>functionality.<lf><lf>Prevents flinching and knockback<lf>when attacked, making it useful for<lf>offensive situations. However, the<lf>damage received is significant, so<lf>caution is advised.
<string>A parrying skill using Wirebugs.<lf><lf>Absorbs an attack from a monster<lf>without taking any damage. Follow<lf>up with a powerful counterattack.<lf><lf>(Wirebug Gauge recovery speed: Fast)
<string>A parrying skill using Wirebugs.<lf><lf>Absorbs an attack from a monster<lf>without taking any damage. Will<lf>shorten the amount of time needed<lf>for a Charged Shot.<lf><lf>(Wirebug Gauge recovery speed: Medium)
<string>Fires a specialized shot, different<lf>depending on the weapon.<lf><lf>The number of rounds is managed<lf>via its own gauge, and replenishes<lf>over time.
<string>Fires a specialized shot, different<lf>depending on the weapon.<lf><lf>The number of rounds is managed via its<lf>own gauge and replenishes over time.<lf><lf>Regular Wyvernheart and Wyvernsnipe<lf>shells inflict less damage, but hits will<lf>replenish the hunter's health.
<string>A regular shot followed by<lf>a particularly powerful shot.<lf><lf>Fires shots with a higher level<lf>of charge than usual.<lf>(Does not exceed maximum level.)
<string>A regular shot followed by<lf>a particularly powerful shot.<lf><lf>Fires shots with a higher level of charge than<lf>usual. (Does not exceed maximum level.)<lf><lf>Standard Power Shots will cost more<lf>stamina, but potentially stun the target.
<string>An evasive skill that covers a lot of<lf>ground.<lf><lf>You can raise your charge level<lf>while dodging, and you can control<lf>the direction you dodge in by tilting<lf><ICON ANALOG_LS> forward, backwards, left,<lf>or right.
<string>A spinning evade that doubles as<lf>an attack.<lf><lf>Baiting the attack and making it<lf>a near-miss can fill up the charge<lf>level considerably. Also allows<lf>you to move forward, backwards,<lf>left, or right.
<string>A Wirebug-based evasion action.<lf><lf>After landing, crouching will cause<lf>stamina to recover at a rapid pace.<lf><lf>(Wirebug Gauge recovery speed: Fast)
