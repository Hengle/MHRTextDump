<string>What to make for dinner tonight...
<string>Whatever it is, Nakago always seems pleased.<lf>He's always gives me compliments on my cooking,<lf>which is purr-etty encouraging.
<string>Purrhaps I'll swing by Kajika's<lf>on the way home and pick up<lf>a nice big fish.
<string><NOFAC>A little bit of this~♪<lf>A little bit of that~♪<lf>Oh, <PL>!
<string>So you're a hunter meow?<lf>Congratulations!
<string>Well then, if your Buddy needs<lf>equipment, just leave it to me<lf>to find them the purr-fect gear!
<string>Y'know Kisaki, the other Buddy Smithy?<lf>Me and him, we both studied under<lf>Meowster Hamon for a loooooong time.
<string>Of course, Nakago and Mihaba are<lf>Meowster Hamon's appurr-entices, too.<lf>But me and Kisaki? We go WAY back.
<string>We've been rivals ever since we could<lf>stand on two paws. We even opened<lf>our shops on the same day!
<string>Around here, they call us the Star-Crossed<lf>Rivals, but, believe it or not, we're actually<lf>good fur-iends!

<string>Around here, they call us the Star-Crossed<lf>Rivals, but, believe it or not, we're actually<lf>good fur-iends!
<string>Kisaki's one of my oldest fur-iends,<lf>but Nakago's my best bud. He can be a<lf>little too laid back, but he's a good guy.
<string>He can also be a bit of klutz. If I don't<lf>keep an eye on him—mew boy...
<string>I can't let him cook because he'll set<lf>the kitchen on fire. Can't let him do<lf>the laundry—he might set that on fire too!
<string>I swear if I wasn't around he might set this<lf>whole village on fire! B-but don't worry,<lf>your gear will be totally fine, purr-omise!
<string>Oh, <PL>!<lf>I heard an Apex Arzuros has shown up!
<string>Sounds like it could be tough. Make sure<lf>your Buddies are purr-operly geared up;<lf>I'm always here to lend a paw!
<string>Nakago is usually purr-etty laid back,<lf>but he's a totally different person when<lf>it comes to his work.
<string>He's super skilled, and his inventions<lf>are really impurr-essive. Meowster Hamon<lf>sure knows how to pick his appurr-entices.
<string>If only Nakago were as good a roommate<lf>as he is a Smithy...
<string>The key to a good lunchbox is cramming<lf>in as many moist, flavorful things as you<lf>can. That's the trick.
<string>But you can't just throw in any old thing. You<lf>gotta consider purr-esentation. Veggies are<lf>excellent when you wanna add a bit of color!
<string>Even if it's just leftovers, putting a<lf>little effort into making it look nice<lf>makes all the diffur-ence.
<string>My morning catnap ran a little late,<lf>so today's lunch is rice balls. They're<lf>simple, so you can make them real fast.
<string>Although, I was running so late, I<lf>didn't even have time to put any filling<lf>inside them. They're just salted rice...
<string>I purr-obably should have just bought<lf>lunch from Seihaku's place instead...
<string>I heard you're going to take on Ibushi,<lf><PL>.
<string>Are your Buddies fully purr-pared fur<lf>the fight? If they need anything, you<lf>know I got you!
<string>Buddy equipment is just as important as<lf>your own gear meow! Don't fur-get it!
<string>It's strange the Rampage hasn't<lf>stopped even though you pounced<lf>on Ibushi...
<string>Hmmm... A meow-stery, for sure.<lf>Is it pawsible that there's something<lf>else causing it?
<string>Meow we've gotta deal with this<lf>Thunder Serpent Narwa thing?
<string>First Ibushi, meow Narwa!<lf>Their names alone sound scary!
<string>Better make sure your Buddies are<lf>purr-operly purr-pared, OK!?
<string>Heading meow-t to take on Narwa,<lf><PL>?
<string>No purr-oblem! You're strong, so I know<lf>you'll be just fine.
<string>Haha, listen to me! I sound just like<lf>Nakago right meow.
<string>He says things so nonchalantly... But<lf>most of what he says turns meow-t to<lf>be true in the end.
<string>So treat this like any old mission.<lf>We'll be cheering you on fur-om here.
<string>I heard Ibushi and Narwa are both<lf>still out there somewhere.
<string>Man, those two really haven't learned<lf>their lesson, have they?
<string>Are you gonna go after them again?
<string>Before you take them down once and fur<lf>all, make sure Buddies are purr-operly<lf>purr-pared! Like always, DON'T FUR-GET!
<string>You can't drink on the job, not in this line<lf>of work! Remember what I said about Nakago<lf>and fire. Not to mention all the sharp edges!
<string>Although a drink sounds purr-fect<lf>right about meow...
<string>What's that? Time for the big show?<lf>Meow boy, I can't help it—I'm fur-reakin' out!
<string>I mean, I've got Nakago over here<lf>constantly pacing around; no wonder<lf>I'm starting to feel antsy.
<string>Maybe I'll just pace around with Nakago<lf>until you get back. Purr-lease come back!
<string>You clobbered TWO dragons and came home<lf>without so much as a scratch... I knew you were<lf>good, but wow! That's just a-meow-zing!
<string>I guess that means that no matter<lf>what big ol' baddie shows up next,<lf>you've got it covered, huh?
<string>What to make for dinner tonight...
<string>Whatever it is, Nakago always seems pleased.<lf>He's always gives me compliments on my cooking,<lf>which is purr-etty encouraging.
<string>Purrhaps I'll swing by Kajika's<lf>on the way home and pick up<lf>a nice big fish.
<string>Nakago's sweet tooth is a force to be<lf>reckoned with... Whatever I make, he<lf>always tries to add sugar to it.
<string>He can't handle spicy food though.<lf>Whenever I make something spicy,<lf>he eats it reeeally slowly.
<string>I can tell he's not into but still eats it<lf>anyway because he knows spicy food is<lf>my favorite. He's such a good fur-iend.
<string>He can seem like a blockhead sometimes,<lf>but it brings a tear to my eye knowing that<lf>he thinks about little details like that.
<string>Ingredient purr-ep is essential<lf>when you're cooking!
<string>Purr-paring beforehand helps save time.<lf>You can cook side dishes while you're<lf>waiting for water to boil, fur example.
<string>It's really simple, but whenever Nakago<lf>watches me cook, it seems to blow his<lf>mind.
<string>I guess that's how I feel when I watch<lf>Nakago at work too, though.
<string>Even though we're fur-iends, our talents<lf>lie in different areas... I guess that's<lf>purr-etty cool, huh?
<string>Nakago said he gets mixed up between<lf>salt and sugar. I know they look the<lf>same, but is he fur real?
<string>Although, I suppose I have the same<lf>problem when it comes to iron-sand<lf>and regular old dirt...
<string>I may know my way around salt and<lf>sugar, but Nakago works the iron-sand<lf>without even having to think about it.
<string>I just don't get him sometimes... But<lf>that's Nakago for you. He's really<lf>something.
<string>Recently, Nakago decided to sharpen our<lf>kitchen knives... Suddenly, my kitchen<lf>has become a much more dangerous place.
<string>Cut a slice off a tomato so thin you can see<lf>through it, but then you'll cut straight through<lf>the tomato, cutting board, AND table!
<string>My poor kitchen table is ruined...
<string>Gee whiskers... Doesn't he know that kitchen<lf>knives don't need to be THAT sharp!? I'm<lf>not descaling a Rathalos!
<string>Although, it does help with meal prep.<lf>I wonder if he'd teach me how to<lf>sharpen blades like that...
<string>Nakago has been working on an invention<lf>for the longest time. Turns out it's a<lf>gizmo that descales fish!
<string>I have to hand it to him, it works really<lf>well! You can even do three at a time!
<string>The only problem is it takes so long that<lf>by the time it's all finished, the fish<lf>has all but dried out.
<string>A chef must use fresh ingredients! He<lf>needs to understand the true basics of<lf>cooking before making these thingies.
<string>That being said, the fact that he made<lf>something with me in mind makes me<lf>happy. He's a great fur-iend.

<string>Meow-za! They'll be floored for sure!
<string><PL>, just who I was hoping<lf>to see! I've got some good mews!
<string>That's right... Now I can forge some sweet<lf><COLS RED>layered armor for your Buddies</COL>!
<string>Buddies gotta get their fashion on too,<lf>ya know! Come see me when you're<lf>ready to get 'em all decked out!
