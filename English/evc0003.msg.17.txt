<string>Good job defeating Magnamalo,<lf>Kamura Hunter!
<string>You are what I call a true hero!
<string>Heeeeeey!
<string>Welcome back!
<string>We heard you beat that Magnamalo!
<string>Way to go!
<string>We've been...thinking about what Elder<lf>Fugen told us.
<string>About what we could do...<lf>To help protect everyone in the village.
<string>But all I can do is take care of Buddies.
<string>And I can only prepare dango for you.
<string>But then we figured that all of the work Iori<lf>does actually makes your life a lot easier.
<string>And my delicious treats keep everyone<lf>happy and in good health!
<string>And that... That's how we contribute<lf>to Kamura.
<string>Fine answer!
<string>I knew Kamura village had the brightest<lf>kids around!
<string>Well, now... I think it's time for me to<lf>get back to doing MY part, don't you think?
<string>Right, me too!
<string>And me three!
<string>OK! Time for some new recipes!
<string>I've been thinking of a Magnamalo menu!
<string>I'd use some dark chocolate...
<string>Sounds heavenly!
<string>Let us know when it's finished!
<string>I gotta say you did a great job, Hunter.
<string>Thank you.
<string>Take it.
<string>This thing's been passed down in Kamura<lf>for generations.
<string>You defeated Magnamalo, so now<lf>it's yours.
<string>Take it will ya?
<string>I'm getting too old to be lugging this<lf>thing around.
<string>Go on!
<string>I feel lighter already, kid!
