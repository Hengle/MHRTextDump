<string><CAM:0>Well, hello there, <PL>!<lf>You sure took forever to get here.<lf>I thought I was gonna croak!
<string>You are probably well aware that<lf>I, Hojo, am the Guild Master of<lf>this exceptional Gathering Hub—
<string>What's that? Your guild registration?<lf>Oh, yes. Well, I was getting to it-to it<lf>before you interrupted me.
<string>Had you let me finish, I would have told<lf>you that we no longer do things that way.<lf>Get with it-with it, young hunter! Johoho!
<string>No tests to take or papers to<lf>stamp! Just my OK and you're<lf>on your way!
<string>And with that, you are now officially<lf>a hunter! And not just any hunter, no!<lf>A hunter of Kamura Village!
<string>Accept a quest from our dearest Minoto<lf>and go hunt some monsters! Johoho!
<string><NPC:102><CAM:1>About that... As much as I'd like<lf>to, I have to get this report about<lf>the Rampage ready for the Guild.
<string>I'm terribly sorry, but could you talk<lf>to Hinoa first, so she can explain<lf>quests to you?
<string><NPC:103>Yo, Ace!
<string><CAM:5,4>I just overheard the gnarly news!<lf>Awesome!
<string>Before you run off to see Hinoa,<lf>pop over here for a sec.
<string>I gotta check you out in your new threads!
<string>Urgent-urgent! Urgent-urgent!
<string>Johoho, an urgent quest has just<lf>arrived for you!
<string>Minoto tells me you are to hunt a monster<lf>that reminds her of me. Surely an exquisite<lf>beast! Was it-was it a Mizutsune?
<string>Well, better ask her to be sure. Johoho!
<string><CAM:0>Well now, <PL>.<lf>Many thanks for handling that urgent<lf>quest. I knew you could do it-do it!
<string>In light of your achievements, we're<lf>promoting you to HR2. You can now<lf>accept <COLS RED>2★</COL> quests from Minoto.
<string>Now then, off you go to pursue<lf>greater quests and ever greater<lf>achievements! Johohoho!
<string><CAM:2><NPC:115><PL>!<lf>A horde of rampagin' monsters<lf>is headin' straight for Kamura!
<string><NPC:116><CAM:3>The villagers near the Stronghold have<lf>taken up arms to defend it. They'll do<lf>their best to hold them off—
<string><NPC:115>But we'll have to deal with any that<lf>get past, into the fort. If we don't,<lf>the village is as good as done.
<string>And that's where you come in!<lf>You'll be tasked with interceptin'<lf>monsters within the Stronghold!
<string><NPC:116>Your HR is still quite low, but<lf>we both believe in the hidden<lf>strength buried deep inside you.
<string>Johoho! Don't worry! Fugen and<lf>I were fresh out of the pond when<lf>we first fought the Rampage.
<string>We survived it, so I'm sure you will<lf>too! You merely have to hunt like<lf>your life depends on it. Johoho!
<string><NPC:115>I'll be commandin' the defenders.<lf><PL>, focus on securin'<lf>the inside of the Stronghold.
<string><NPC:116>You can get urgent quests<lf>for the Rampage from Minoto<lf>as they come in.
<string>Good luck to you, <PL>!<lf>You are certainly going to<lf>need it-need it!
<string><CAM:0>Well done, <PL>.<lf>We successfully fought off the<lf>Rampage without casualty.
<string>Above all, your defense of<lf>the Stronghold was exemplary!<lf>I knew you had it in you!
<string>But the Rampage has only just begun...<lf>The Monsters will become stronger<lf>and more numerous!
<string>Why monsters will form groups<lf>and attack our village is yet<lf>unknown to us.
<string>I just hope we'll find answers<lf>before it's too late!
<string>For now, focus on polishing your skills.<lf>Do that by taking on the quests available<lf>to you. And speaking of availability!
<string>Minoto tells me you haven't completed<lf>all of the 2★ quests yet, so hop to it-to it, <lf>Hunter! Johoho!
<string>There's a terrifying toothy beast afoot!
<string><PL>!<lf>An urgent quest awaits you!
<string>You are to confront <COLS RED>Magnamalo</COL>,<lf>the Wyvern of Malice. It has been<lf>sighted alongside the Rampage.
<string>We have been tracking its movement<lf>for some time and now it's steadily<lf>moving towards the group.
<string>Once it descends upon the horde,<lf>it will begin to feast and the calamity<lf>will intensify.
<string>It's a lot to ask of a HR2 hunter,<lf>but I know how capable you are!<lf>Quickly, there's no time to lose!
<string><CAM:0><PL>!<lf>You triumphed over Magnamalo!<lf>Johohoho! Congratulations!
<string>In light of a most marvelous hunt,<lf>we're promoting you to HR3! You may<lf>now accept <COLS RED>3★</COL> quests from Minoto.
<string>As the Rampage grows in momentum,<lf>you must continue to hone your skills!<lf>Accept these new quests and hop to it!
<string><CAM:2><NPC:115><PL>!<lf>A large horde of rampagin' monsters<lf>is threatenin' the village!
<string><NPC:116><CAM:3>The Hunter's Guild's investigations have<lf>revealed a monster directing the Rampage<lf>from the center of the horde!
<string>Hmm...
<string><FACE:SER><VO:SER>It seems an <COLS RED>"Apex"</COL> has appeared.<lf>This powerful monster lords<lf>over an enormous territory.
<string>At some point, it must have joined<lf>the Rampage, and taken command<lf>of part of the horde...
<string><NPC:115><VO:NOR><PL>... When Hoj has<lf>that look on his face, it means<lf>you best be real careful!
<string>An experienced hunter's senses are<lf>finely tuned to what's goin' on. This<lf>ain't gonna be your average hunt.
<string><NPC:116><VO:SER>Even so, we can't change course now.<lf>Like before, the villagers will defend<lf>the perimeter while you focus on inside.
<string><NPC:115><VO:NOR>An <COLS RED>Arzuros</COL> is the Apex monster<lf>leadin' the assault! Take it down<lf>and Kamura is safe!
<string>Now, go get to it!
<string><CAM:2><NPC:115><VO:SER>That monster was likely an elder<lf>dragon. But why haven't we seen<lf>it before? We need answers now!
<string><CAM:3>Somethin' else is botherin' me...<lf>The way Hinoa reacted when it<lf>appeared.
<string><NPC:116>It seems Hinoa..."resonated" with it.
<string>Hinoa has always been able to sense<lf>Minoto's emotions, even from a distance.<lf>We call that "resonance."
<string>And, for some reason, Hinoa<lf>resonated with that fiendish beast.
<string><PL>.<lf>The Guild will investigate this matter.
<string>You can now accept <COLS RED>4★</COL> quests.<lf>If you could take care of those,<lf>that would be an enormous help.
<string><NPC:115>And one more thing. Do your best<lf>to cheer up Minoto. She's been cryin'<lf>ever since she got back to the village.
<string>Busy indeed! Johoho!
<string>Johoho, <PL>!<lf>An urgent quest awaits you.
<string>A <COLS RED>Jyuratodus</COL> was sighted in the Flooded<lf>Forest. A scout was tracking the beast<lf>but we have lost contact with them!
<string>I ask that you dispatch the Jyuratodus<lf>so that a search party may recover<lf>the missing scout.
<string><CAM:0>Oh, hello!<lf>I'm glad to see you're safe.
<string>Thanks to you, johoho, the search party<lf>was able to locate the missing scout.
<string>Something peculiar occurred on their way<lf>back! It happened just as they had passed<lf>by a site ravaged by the Rampage...
<string>In the distance they sighted an azure<lf>beast roving about. And then, just like<lf>that, GONE!
<string>What they described sounds eerily<lf>similar to the fiend that appeared<lf>just after the Rampage.
<string>But I don't know what it could mean...<lf>We'll keep investigating the matter, so<lf>you keep doing what you do best.
<string>And speaking of, you may now<lf>accept <COLS RED>5★</COL> quests. Check in with<lf>Minoto, she'll have the details.
<string>Urgent-urgent! Urgent-urgent!
<string>Hello again, <PL>!<lf>An urgent quest awaits you!
<string>You've been requested to dispatch an<lf>agitated <COLS RED>Mizutsune</COL> in the Shrine Ruins.
<string>Usually docile, we rarely pay these creatures<lf>any mind. However this particular Mizutsune<lf>has gone hopping mad!
<string>I just don't get it-get it...
<string>The Guild will investigate this matter further.<lf>Your job is to ensure the monster is<lf>dealt with swiftly. Now hop to it-to it!
<string><CAM:2><NPC:116><FACE:SER><VO:SER>We have found our answers...
<string>The answer to that which has plagued<lf>Kamura... <COLS RED>The cause of the Rampage</COL>!
<string><NPC:115><CAM:3>And you huntin' that poor<lf>ol' Mizu led us to the answer.
<string>When the Guild was investigatin'<lf>the monsters around it, they came<lf>across several telltale signs.
<string>And they were connected to<lf>the Rampage. The Rampage<lf>AND that azure fiend!
<string><NPC:116>And that's not all! Our scouts<lf>informed us that they had spotted that<lf>azure beast above the Shrine Ruins.
<string>Shortly after its appearance, every<lf>monster in the vicinity became<lf>feverishly violent!
<string>And that Mizutsune, being in mating<lf>season, was intensely affected...
<string><NPC:115>We always thought that monsters<lf>attackin' human settlements<lf>was simply nature at work.
<string>As it turns out, it was really the work of<lf>this monster. Whippin' all the monsters<lf>into a frenzy, causing them to migrate.
<string>That's the secret behind the Rampage!
<string><NPC:116>And that is why there were always<lf>sightings of that beast shortly<lf>after the Rampage started.
<string>The Guild has named this fearsome<lf>monster <COLS RED>Wind Serpent Ibushi</COL>. The<lf>cause of the Rampage must be slain.
<string>We are sure it won't be long before it<lf>returns once more. When that time<lf>comes, we're all counting on you.
<string>While we wait for further reports,<lf>please proceed with the newly<lf>available <COLS RED>6★</COL> quests.
<string><CAM:2><NPC:116><PL>!<lf>Another large wave of rampaging<lf>monsters is closing in on us.
<string><CAM:3>And <COLS RED>Wind Serpent Ibushi</COL> is driving<lf>the horde from behind. Your task will<lf>be to slay the beast.
<string><NPC:115>The villagers defendin' the Stronghold<lf>will do their best to draw Ibushi out.<lf>As usual, you'll be standin' by inside.
<string>The calamity that threatens Kamura<lf>ends today!
<string>Alright, <PL>!<lf>Our fate is in your hands!<lf>Now go get to it!
<string><CAM:2><NPC:116>You have done well, <PL>!<lf>The Wind Serpent has been repelled.
<string><NPC:115><CAM:3>I thought that the Rampage<lf>would simmer down, but<lf>something's not right.
<string>We're still tryin' to figure out why Ibushi<lf>has appeared and now there's the question<lf>of this "queen" that Hinoa spoke of.
<string><NPC:116>While the Guild gathers more information,<lf>please continue to accept 6★ quests.<lf>There's enough left to keep you busy.
<string>I have an...unusual quest for you.
<string>Hello, <PL>!<lf>An urgent quest awaits you!
<string>Your task is to hunt down a rather<lf>large <COLS RED>Rakna-Kadaki</COL> causing<lf>a disturbance in the Lava Caverns.
<string>The appearance of this monster is<lf>quite concerning as they have never<lf>been spotted in this locale before.
<string>Hmmm... This peculiar occurrence as well<lf>as Minoto's strange behavior as of late...<lf>Certainly there is a connection, no?
<string>In any case, we're counting on you<lf>to hunt Rakna-Kadaki. Hop to it-to it,<lf>Hunter of Kamura!
<string><CAM:2><NPC:115><VO:SER>Ah, you're back, <PL>.
<string><CAM:3>One of our researchers was sayin' that<lf>Rakna-Kadaki was actin' the same as<lf>other monsters under Ibushi's influence.
<string>But I thought the Wind Serpent tucked<lf>tail and ran off. If Ibushi's out of the<lf>picture, what's causin' this mess? Hmm...
<string>Somethin' ain't right. It's almost<lf>as if there's a second Rampage<lf>brewin'...
<string><NPC:116><FACE:SER>"Where is my queen? Where is my queen?"
<string>That is what Hinoa heard when resonating<lf>with Ibushi. Even with this lead, we were<lf>getting nowhere. That is, until now...
<string>We have discovered what this "queen"<lf>is, or rather, Minoto has...
<string><NPC:115>Yes, for better or worse, it looks<lf>like Minoto also has the "gift"<lf>of resonatin' with monsters.
<string>And with this new information, the Guild<lf>has confirmed that this "queen" is<lf>an elder dragon...
<string>And its name is <COLS RED>Thunder Serpent Narwa</COL>.
<string>If we're ever gonna stop the Rampage,<lf>and free Kamura from this calamity,<lf>we need to slay this fiend.
<string>We have all of our scouts out searchin'<lf>for the Thunder Serpent. It won't take<lf>us long to locate it.
<string><NPC:116>And when that happens,<lf>the final battle will be yours<lf>to fight, <PL>.
<string>Until then, please continue to accept<lf>quests from Minoto. <COLS RED>7★</COL> quests are<lf>available now, so hop to it-to it!
<string><CAM:2><NPC:115><VO:SER>First we find out both Hinoa<lf>AND Minoto can resonate with<lf>monsters, and now this...
<string><CAM:3>I sent Utsushi out to confirm that Narwa<lf>had been dealt with but he couldn't find<lf>any sign of her smelly carcass.
<string>I have no doubt in my mind that<lf>both Ibushi and Narwa still live.
<string><NPC:116>The Guild is already working to<lf>locate them with the twins' help.
<string>Should the two dragons meet,<lf>it will spell disaster for us all.<lf>We must end this now.
<string><NPC:115>Looks like Kamura still needs<lf>your help, <PL>.
<string><VO:NOR>We'll get everything ready on<lf>our end. Maybe we can finally<lf>put an end to the Rampage!
<string>Urgent-urgent!
<string>Why, hello there, <PL>. An urgent<lf>quest has come up.
<string>A <COLS RED>Chameleos</COL> is causing trouble<lf>in the Shrine Ruins. You'll need<lf>to get rid of it-rid of it.
<string>It's not often the old mist wyvern makes<lf>its presence known. Perhaps the Rampage<lf>has something to do with it?
<string>In any case, you've the strength to best<lf>this beast—but you mustn't be careless,<lf>or else you might end up as dinner!
<string>Johoho, just as expected!
<string>My my, <PL>, a job well done!
<string>You've slain the Chameleos—an unequivocal<lf>testament to the advancement of your skills,<lf>and far more quickly than I had foreseen...
<string>Johoho, I'm just giddy with<lf>anticipation to see how much<lf>more powerful you'll become!
<string>Make sure you keep up the good<lf>work and get that HR as high as<lf>you can!
<string>We've got trouble!
<string><PL>!<lf>I've an urgent quest for you!
<string>As we speak, a <COLS RED>Kushala Daora</COL><lf>threatens to lay waste to the<lf>Frost Islands.
<string>The winds it calls alone could<lf>plunge the entire region into<lf>sheer oblivion!
<string>There's not a soul I would trust<lf>to handle a crisis like this more<lf>than you. Now then, hop to it-to it!
<string>I know you could do it-do it!
<string>Ah, <PL>!<lf>Good to see you made<lf>it back safe and sound.
<string>The threat posed by Kushala Daora has been<lf>quelled, thanks to you, and things should<lf>quieten down in the Frost Islands now.
<string>You're becoming such a splendid<lf>hunter! It does my aged heart good<lf>to watch you grow so...
<string>But! The path of a hunter does<lf>not end; it is a constant journey.
<string>I look forward to seeing where<lf>yours takes you! Johoho!
<string><PL>! Good to see you!
<string>I've got an urgent quest!<lf>You know what that means?<lf>Yes! Time to hop to it-to it!
<string>It's been confirmed that a <COLS RED>Teostra</COL><lf>is prowling about the Lava Caverns.
<string>This beast is fiery, even more so than your<lf>average elder dragon. It even scorches the<lf>earth when it gets mad, for goodness's sake!
<string>This is a crisis we can't resolve a moment<lf>too soon. Good luck, <PL>.
<string>Welcome back!
<string>So, <PL>,<lf>you extinguished Teostra's flame!
<string>Excellent. Your efforts today put<lf>an end to the danger in the Lava<lf>Caverns without casualty.
<string>And yet, the elder dragons keep<lf>appearing...
<string>I can't help but ponder whether this<lf>means a head-to-head confrontation<lf>with Ibushi and Narwa is close at hand...?
<string>Ah, but elder dragon, smelder dragon!<lf>We have you here, so what's there to<lf>be afraid of?
<string>Well, <PL>!<lf>There's still more for you<lf>to achieve! Hop to it-to it!
<string><CAM:2><NPC:115><PL>! We finally figured out where<lf><COLS RED>Ibushi and Narwa</COL> are hidin' out!
<string><CAM:3><NPC:116><FACE:SER><VO:SER>Yes! The pair have already<lf>reunited at the <COLS RED>Coral Palace</COL>.
<string>"Children, flood this land," were<lf>the words Hinoa and Minoto<lf>recited while resonating.
<string>We can assume they foretell the<lf>birth of many more wind and thunder<lf>serpents, if we fail to stop them. And...
<string>Should that happen, the whole land will fall<lf>to the Rampage. Then—well, suffice it to say<lf>we'll all be up the creek without a paddle.
<string><NPC:115><VO:NOR>That's why ya gotta get a move on!<lf>If you can't put a stop to this in time,<lf>Kamura and everyone else is doomed!
<string>Now's when we need that blazin'<lf>spirit of yours to lead the hunt,<lf>more than ever!
<string>Johoho, just as expected!
<string>Oh, hello, <PL>!<lf>Did you stuff your belly at the feast?
<string>Johoho, I let myself go a little bit too!
<string>And why not? Your actions have<lf>brought us that much closer to<lf>subduing the Rampage.
<string>Ah, <PL>, you've become<lf>such an incredible hunter...
<string>*sigh* You already remind<lf>so much of myself when<lf>I was a just a tadpole.
<string>Now, you've only to iron out<lf>the finer details! Mastery<lf>takes diligence, after all!
<string>...Well, what are you waiting for?<lf>Those monsters won't hunt themselves,<lf>you know! Hop to it-to it!
<string>Quite troubling indeed!
<string><PL>!<lf>We've received news from<lf>the Guild of a dire situation!
<string>The <COLS RED>Valstrax</COL> has appeared. It typically<lf>lives at high altitudes, so sightings of<lf>this elder dragon are few and far between.
<string>An old tome describes it as a comet of doom<lf>that "shall deliver all unto ruin."<lf>If it's true, we are in grave danger!
<string>But the sighting account does not entirely<lf>accord with what is written in the records.<lf>A puzzling discrepancy, for sure...
<string>Well, dearest Savior of Kamura,<lf>go knock that comet right out<lf>of the sky!
<string>Johoho! You did it-did it!
<string>Well, well, well! Even the menacing<lf>Crimson Glow is no match for the<lf>Savior of Kamura!
<string>I've never been so delighted in all<lf>my time as a Guild manager, or<lf>as your doting guardian.
<string><PL>! You've accomplished<lf>so much! Yet there is still more to do!<lf>Johoho! Now hop to it-to it!
<string>Hello there, <PL>.<lf>We're dealing with the Rampage, so<lf>I'm afraid Minoto is a tadpole bit busy.
<string>For the time being, you'll have<lf>to get your quests from Hinoa.
<string>Johoho! Welcome back! Minoto<lf>is finally available to issue quests.
<string>So if you'd like to accept a Hub quest,<lf>now's your chance!
<string>Remember, <PL>,<lf>Hub quests are intended for a group<lf>of four hunters.
<string>It IS possible to go them alone,<lf>however, you need to prepare<lf>very, very carefully.
<string>If you so desire to take on Hub quests,<lf>it is recommended to challenge them<lf>with a party of fellow hunters.
<string>If you are looking to train your skills,<lf>Hinoa has a selection of quests that<lf>are suited to solo hunters.
<string>Minoto has an urgent quest for you!
<string>She says it's a monster that reminds<lf>her of me. And that could only be<lf>a Mizutsune!
<string>Its attacks will be as elegant<lf>and magnificent as my own,<lf>so you must be cautious.
<string>Hello there, <PL>! Going<lf>out to hunt my monster doppelganger,<lf>are you? The Mizutsune?
<string>Wh-What's that? She was actually referring<lf>to a Tetranadon and NOT a Mizutsune!?<lf>......
<string>Oh, I get it-get it! We both<lf>possess quite an imposing<lf>presence! Johoho!
<string>She's always been quite the flatterer,<lf>that girl! Johoho, would you look<lf>at me, I'm blushing!
<string>Well... The Rampage is upon us.
<string>The villagers will defend the perimeter<lf>of the Stronghold. They've got sharp,<lf>pointy things! They'll be fine.
<string>Your job will be to defend inside<lf>the Stronghold, hunting anything<lf>that makes it inside.
<string>If the Stronghold falls, the monsters<lf>will devastate Kamura. We must<lf>prevent that at any cost!

<string>Hello there, <PL>.<lf>Hunts going well, are they?
<string>Just a little tip-tip about 2★ quests. You'll be<lf>visiting a new locale, so you'll need to get<lf>acquainted with the terrain and its effects.
<string>Minoto has an urgent quest for you<lf>to hunt Magnamalo, the "Wyvern of<lf>Malice." A frighteningly vicious beast!
<string>It has some sort of connection with<lf>the Rampage and has terrorized<lf>Kamura time and time again...
<string>Why, it's, <PL>!<lf>Completing quests quicker than a toad<lf>catches flies, are you?
<string>You be careful out there now. If you<lf>are hurt my best—and, johoho, most<lf>profitable— hunter will be gone!
<string>Ah, n-not that I don't have full faith<lf>in your abilities! I know you'll come<lf>back safe and sound, sure as sure is!
<string>Well, well, <PL>.<lf>The Rampage is drawing closer.
<string>This time, we've sighted a horde<lf>led by an Apex monster. That'll<lf>be your target.
<string>Something is in the air, I can feel it!<lf>Hinoa said she sensed the same<lf>thing... Tread carefully out there.
<string><VO:SER>I never imagined Hinoa would resonate<lf>with a monster... She seems to have<lf>recovered now, but still...
<string>More worrying is Minoto. She's<lf>so level-headed, but just falls<lf>apart when Hinoa's in trouble.
<string><VO:SER>Hmmm...<lf>The air feels heavy around Minoto.
<string>She's angry at the monster Hinoa<lf>resonated with and frustrated with<lf>her own helplessness.
<string>Minoto has always respected her sister<lf>to the point of self-deprecation. I think<lf>that's the problem here.
<string>Minoto has her own amazing qualities,<lf>but fails to see that she can leap just<lf>as high as her sister.
<string>Hmm... Perhaps if she saw just<lf>what Hinoa resonated with, she'd<lf>regain some of her confidence...
<string><PL>!<lf>Get going to the Flooded Forest<lf>and hunt that Jyuratodus!
<string>We'll send out a search party to find<lf>our missing scout, but it's up to you<lf>to deal with that Jyuratodus!
<string>Hmmm... Why would it go to<lf>the Flooded Forest with the<lf>Rampage so near?
<string><VO:SER>And the matter of this azure dragon and<lf>the Rampage. Is their simultaneous<lf>appearance a mere coincidence?
<string>Well, nothing will come from just<lf>thinking about it, I suppose.
<string>We of Kamura and the Guild will<lf>do our best to investigate, and<lf>let you know if we find anything.
<string><VO:SER>Hmm... The Mizutsune in the<lf>Shrine Ruins have never been<lf>particularly aggressive beasts.
<string>However, we can't have such a hyper-<lf>agitated beast in such close proximity<lf>to the village. Shame...
<string><VO:NOR>Well then, <PL>,<lf>off you go!
<string><VO:SER>With what little we knew until now,<lf>it always seemed that the Rampage<lf>was merely an act of aggression.
<string>Who could have possible known that<lf>this was all the doing of one monster?
<string>In any case, this discovery couldn't<lf>have come at a better time.
<string><PL>, you have done<lf>well. It's thanks to your hard work that<lf>we have survived for this long.
<string>If we slay Ibushi, the Rampage<lf>will end. Trust in that and await<lf>further information.
<string><PL>...<lf>We are counting on you to slay<lf>Ibushi!
<string>The time has come to rid Kamura<lf>of the calamity that has plagued it<lf>for so very long...
<string>And save our dear Hinoa as well.
<string>I hope to hear, "This is for Hinoa, and<lf>Kamura!" echoing throughout the land<lf>as you land the final blow! Johohoho!
<string>Dearest, <PL>!<lf>What a show, Hunter of Kamura!<lf>WHAT. A. SHOW!
<string>Hinoa mentioned that she can<lf>no longer sense Ibushi's presence.
<string>It is my hope that the injuries that<lf>you have inflicted upon the beast<lf>will lead to its ultimate demise.
<string>Yet strangely, the Rampage shows no<lf>sign of slowing. Something is not right...<lf>We cannot let our guard down just yet!
<string><VO:SER>Puzzling... Minoto is usually so well-<lf>focused on her work, yet she seems<lf>so distracted as of late.
<string>I'll keep an eye on her. I need<lf>yours focused on hunting that<lf>Rakna-Kadaki!
<string>It's presence in the Caverns is odd,<lf>to say the least. It's never been<lf>sighted outside of its natural habitat.
<string>I have a terrible feeling about this.<lf>Take care, <PL>.
<string>It is now certain that Ibushi's queen,<lf>the Thunder Serpent Narwa, still lives.
<string>Though this is unfortunate news, we should<lf>be thankful that twins' ability led us to<lf>this information before it was too late.
<string>I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that<lf>twins would possess the same gift.<lf>Yet, I must admit, I was taken aback.
<string>At any rate, if we can slay Narwa,<lf>the calamity brought about by the<lf>Rampage will end! We are so close!
<string><VO:SER>As soon as Narwa was located, all of<lf>our hunters went to confront it, but<lf>as you've heard, they got stomped.
<string><PL>, you are the<lf>only one who can save Kamura from<lf>this calamity now. Maybe it's destiny.
<string>...I won't keep you from it.
<string><VO:NOR>Go forth, Hunter of Kamura,<lf><PL> the Fierce!
<string>Slay all foes who threaten this village!<lf>Show the world your valor and your<lf>determination!
<string>The twins have sensed the return<lf>of Ibushi and Narwa! Stubborn as<lf>toadstools these beasts are.
<string>If those two meet, we'll be out of the<lf>frying pan and into the fire! Just the<lf>thought of it... *shudders*
<string><PL>. The bounty of<lf>food and drink we saved from the canceled<lf>banquet has been stored in the Tea Shop.
<string>You must swiftly slay both dragons<lf>before the food spoils!
<string>I expect you to leap into action,<lf>the moment they are located!
<string><VO:SER>It appears that Ibushi and<lf>Narwa have already reunited<lf>in the Coral Palace.
<string>At this rate, all the land will be over-<lf>whelmed by Rampage... Which is why<lf>I am asking you to put a stop to it-to it!
<string>It's a quest fraught with danger, and I<lf>loathe to put you in harm's way...but<lf>I must. So please...come back safely.
<string>You truly defeated Wind Serpent<lf>Ibushi and Thunder Serpent Narwa...
<string>Their power stubbornly remains,<lf>and it will take some time before<lf>the Rampage totally subsides.
<string>But as long as we have the greatest hunter<lf>around and the unity of our fellow citizens,<lf>Kamura Village has nothing to fear! Johoho!
<string><PL>! Good to see you!<lf>Hard at hunting still, I trust?
<string>It may still be a little longer before the<lf>Rampage relents entirely, but that shouldn't<lf>be a problem with you here.
<string>All you have to do is keep hunting as<lf>enthusiastically as you always have, and<lf>the village will be as safe as can be!
<string>Looking at you, <PL>, takes<lf>me back. I used to change your diapers,<lf>you know! What a mess you'd make!
<string>And look at you now! All grown up!<lf>You've become a fine hunter. I'm glad<lf>to have lived long enough to see it.
<string>Have you seen my monster illustrations<lf>on the Quest Board? Pretty good, no?
<string>Minoto is learning as well. She has<lf>potential, but she hates how her<lf>pictures always come out cutesy...
<string>Long ago, Fugen and Hamon<lf>were quite famous hunters.
<string>The fiery Fugen and the cool-as-ice<lf>Hamon were total opposites, but<lf>their teamwork was legendary.
<string>And me? Well, I was the strongest<lf>so naturally I was the leader!<lf>...Wait, I am being serious!
<string>Minoto used to cling to Hinoa all<lf>of the time and wouldn't even look<lf>at or talk to anyone else.
<string>But since the people of Kamura are so<lf>kind, she quickly warmed up to everyone<lf>and made friends with the entire village.
<string>...Although, she still clings to Hinoa.<lf>That hasn't changed in the slightest.
<string>Have you seen my monster illustrations<lf>on the Quest Board? Pretty good, no?
<string>Minoto is learning as well. She has<lf>potential, but she hates how her<lf>pictures always come out cutesy...
<string>Fifty years ago, the Rampage came<lf>and left Kamura in ruins. It's a bitter<lf>memory to recall.
<string>Fugen was the one to lead<lf>the reconstruction of the village.
<string>Even though he was battered and<lf>beaten from fighting, his cheerful<lf>approach encouraged us all.
<string>One thing led to another, and eventually<lf>Fugen became the village elder. And<lf>there's no better man for the job!
<string>Have you seen my monster illustrations<lf>on the Quest Board? Pretty good, no?
<string>Minoto is learning as well. She has<lf>potential, but she hates how her<lf>pictures always come out cutesy...
<string>After the Rampage fifty years ago,<lf>Hamon played a vital role in restoring<lf>the village to its former glory.
<string>Having come from a long line of smiths,<lf>he used their bellows and helped rebuild<lf>our village to how it is today!
<string>In the midst of that, he perfected<lf>his craft and is now the finest<lf>smith in Kamura.
<string>He can be a bit abrupt at times, but<lf>that's not because of his work. He's<lf>just always been like that. Johoho!
<string>Fifty years ago, during the last Rampage,<lf>Fugen, Hamon, and myself were the<lf>central hunting team trying to stop it.
<string>But we were outnumbered...<lf>I ran to the Guild to gather any hunter<lf>who would aid us. Yet we failed.
<string>I have since devoted my life to making<lf>sure that failure doesn't repeat, and thus<lf>I became Guild Master of this village.
<string>I don't dwell on my failure. I use my<lf>experience to help hunters, like yourself,<lf>grow. And now, I couldn't be happier!
<string>If you listen carefully, you'll<lf>hear Yomogi's cheerful voice<lf>from the Tea Shop.
<string>She's been through a lot,<lf>and I'm glad she can laugh<lf>as happily as she always does.
<string>Gained a lot of experience out<lf>in the field, have you? Johoho!
<string>Stay ever-hungry! There is<lf>always more for a hunter<lf>to learn!
<string>I have a request!
<string>Hello there, <PL>.<lf>I have a request from the Guild.
<string>There's ongoing research about the<lf><COLS RED>Rathalos</COL> living in this area, and the<lf>Guild wants you to capture one for them.
<string>Given your skills, I'm sure it'll be<lf>just a hop in the park! Johoho!
<string>You did it-did it!
<string>Welcome back. Your timing couldn't<lf>be better. Your reward from the Guild<lf>has just been delivered!
<string>Lately, even the Guild has been<lf>stepping in to investigate any<lf>monster activity near the village.
<string>Today, you have made a very<lf>important contribution to help<lf>forward scientific research.
<string>As a reward, the Guild has shared<lf>schematics for a new kind of weapon.<lf>I sent it all straight to the Smithy.
<string>Johoho! Dependable as ever!
<string>Ah, hello there, <PL>!<lf>A spot of good news for you: The Guild was<lf>quite impressed by your recent efforts.
<string><NOTE:212>My, my. Isn't that wonderful? But that's<lf>not all: as a reward for your endeavors,<lf>you're to receive this Guild Ticket!
<string>Keep up the good work, and you're sure to<lf>be recognized for it again—in the form of<lf>more Guild Tickets, no doubt. Johohoho!
<string>Johoho! Dependable as ever!
<string>Ah, hello there, <PL>!<lf>A spot of good news for you: The Guild was<lf>quite impressed by your recent efforts.
<string>Johoho, here you go! One Guild Ticket<lf>with your name on it, as recognition for<lf>all your hard hunting work!
