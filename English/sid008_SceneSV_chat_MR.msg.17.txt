<string>I knew I'd go hunting today,<lf>so I did my best to prepare!
<string>In other words, I ate five extra<lf>plates of Bunny Dango!
<string>I feel bad for making Minoto<lf>all worried...
<string>But I've been wanting to go<lf>hunting with you so badly!
<string><PL>!<lf>Thanks for inviting me today!
<string>I'm looking forward to taking<lf>on this quest together!
<string><PL>,<lf>let's do our best today!
<string>Hehehe... Today is like<lf>a dream come true!
<string>OK, <PL>,<lf>time to get hunting!
<string>And the harder we work,<lf>the yummier the dango will be!
<string>Minoto! Don't say that!<lf>You can easily hold your own!
<string>There's so much about you<lf>that I admire...
<string>Elder Fugen and I were so excited to<lf>go hunting, I think we ate too much!
<string>There's no food left... But I still have<lf>some candy apples in my pouch!
<string>Come out hunting? It's a little<lf>dangerous for her, no?
<string>Hmmm... Well, maybe when she's<lf>a little older, huh?
<string>I summon thee! Wind! WIND!<lf>*sigh* This isn't working...
<string>If only I could harness Wind<lf>Serpent Ibushi's power...
<string>Oh, stop. Admit it! You needed to<lf>get out of that musty old hub!
<string>And don't tell me you haven't been<lf>having a good time in Elgado.
<string>Oh, give it a rest!<lf>Let's have some fun!
<string>It's not often we get to go out together!<lf>Let's make the best of it!
<string>OK, Minoto!<lf>Show me what you got!
<string>Uh... If a horde of elder dragons<lf>show up, we should run, right?
<string>I can't believe how popular<lf>Bunny Dango are in Elgado!
<string>Hmmm... How about I tell you all about<lf>it over some dango when we get back!?
<string>Your sister has a very<lf>dignified air about her!
<string>I admire her a lot! I'm more the laid-<lf>back type...maybe too laid-back!
<string>You've really gotten into<lf>your merchant work, hm?
<string>Well, I hope you find some new dango<lf>ingredients to trade to Yomogi!
