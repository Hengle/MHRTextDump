<string>Heeeeey!
<string>Looks like things've calmed down a bit.
<string>Elder Fugen wants us to go back to camp!
<string>Whoa... This one looks really strong...
<string>We don't have any orders...
<string>Let's retreat!
<string>Aah! It's coming after us!
<string>That monster is known as...<lf>Magnamalo.
<string>It appears alongside the Rampage<lf>and feeds on the horde.
<string>It eats them!?
<string>Fifty years ago, Kamura Village was<lf>attacked by the Rampage and Magnamalo.
<string>And we suffered some devastating<lf>casualties.
<string>So that could...happen again?
<string>Wha—!? That's terrible!
<string>How can we fight against that!?
<string>Don't worry, Yomogi.
<string>This time round, we have a skilled<lf>hunter by our side.
<string>I want you to slay Magnamalo for us.
<string>We need you to protect Kamura Village!
<string>I wanna help fight!<lf>I'm coming with you!
<string>Me too!
<string>I don't know how much help I can be<lf>though...
<string>That's the spirit!
<string>However...this is something that needs<lf>to be handled by a hunter.
<string>But—!
<string>Kamura is more...than steel and hunters.
<string>The two of you...should focus on the<lf>things you do best.
<string>The things...
<string>We do best?
<string>You two have to be strong every day.
<string>That way, the answer will come to you<lf>before long.
<string>Right, let's head back to the village.
