<string>Got a li'l somethin' fur ya!
<string><NOFAC>Congratulations on completing your fur-st<lf>online quest! I've got a li'l something fur ya!
<string>As you complete quests online, you'll<lf>accu-mew-late <COLS RED>Friend Points</COL>.
<string>Once you've gained enough of them,<lf>you'll get an item as a reward! And it's<lf>purr-etty handy too!
<string>It's paw-sible to get other items, too! Just<lf>keep hunting with your fur-iends and you're<lf>sure to get more! Happy hunting!
<string>Got a li'l somethin' fur ya!
<string><NOFAC>Hey, <PL>!<lf>Looks like you've been going meow-t<lf>on a lot of quests since the big update!
<string>Got a li'l somethin' fur ya since you've<lf>been working so hard!
<string>And if you keep raising your hunter and<lf>master rank, the items you'll receive with<lf><COLS RED>Friend Points</COL> will be even more impurr-essive!
<string>Remember: Keep hunting with your<lf>fur-iends and you're sure to get more!<lf>Happy hunting!
<string>Meowllo there, <PL>. A little<lf>birdie told me you're heading to the<lf>Kingdom's outpost.
<string>I'm afur-raid I can't come with you,<lf>but never fear, the Outpost has its<lf>very own Courier!
<string>But don't fur-get to come back and<lf>visit us sometimes, meow!
<string>Meowllo there, <PL>. I heard that<lf>meownsters from the Kingdom are even more<lf>fur-ocious than meownsters in Kamura!
<string>How do I know this? Meow, meow, meow!<lf>Don't underestimate the Courier's infurmation<lf>network.
<string>I know everything. I know how many<lf>Bunny Dango you ate before your hunt.<lf>How much dung you keep in your item—
<string>*ahem* Anyway, it's a Courier's duty<lf>to always stay in-the-know! All part<lf>of our fur-st class service!
<string>Meowllo there, <PL>. Not much<lf>going on since the Rampage, but recently<lf>things have been picking up little by little.
<string>Couriers aren't really good at sitting<lf>around twiddling their paws, so it feels<lf>good to be busy again!
<string>This "Offline, Online" job Elder Fugen<lf>gave me is great and all, but honestly<lf>I pre-fur my Courier work...

<string>Meowllo there, <PL>!<lf>I heard you've been hunting some seriously<lf>fur-ocious meownsters!
<string>If you need meowtivation you can try<lf>reciting this daily affur-mation in front<lf>of a mirror. I purr-omise it helps!
<string>Meowllo there, <PL>!<lf>I heard you've been doing well in Elgado!
<string>How do I know that? Come on!<lf>Us Couriers are everywhere! Here,<lf>there! We're even in the walls!
<string>Haha! Look at your face! I'm just kidding!<lf>The Courier in Elgado told me, silly!
<string>All these years of delivering mail has done<lf>wonders for my meowscles. Feel these<lf>bad boys!
<string>Purr-obably nothing compared to your<lf>meowscles! I bet your gluteus meowximus<lf>is as hard as a Basarios's backside!
<string>Anymew, as long as I have what it takes to<lf>be a Courier, then that's enough for me.
