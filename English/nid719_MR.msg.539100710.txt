<string>Get a load of this, Hunter!
<string>Ahoy, Hunter! I got BIG news! I think<lf>I might've just made an amazing discovery!
<string>I've always loved tinkering with gadgets<lf>and stuff, that's what got me this job<lf>here, workin' on weaponry and such.
<string>Anyway, before, while I was test-firing<lf>a ballista, I stumbled across a way to<lf>up the power massively using coal!
<string>Trouble is, I can't put it to practical use<lf>without more experimentation. That's<lf>where you come in! I need Aeonian Coal!
<string>Thanks a bunch!
<string>Sweet! Hopefully I can get this idea off<lf>the ground! Thanks a bunch, Hunter!
<string>For helping me out, I gave Minayle some<lf>details about upgrading a bowgun.<lf>Go bananas!

<string>Good to see ya! You look a little surprised.<lf>Guess you didn't expect a sailor to be<lf>mindin' a juice stand, did ya?
<string>Well, working next to a giant crater<lf>caused by an elder dragon is what we<lf>call an "occupational hazard."
<string>In other words, it's not safe for normal folks<lf>to work here. But Elgado still needs supplies<lf>and nothing lifts a knight's spirit like juice!
<string>Me working here was the Guild's idea, but<lf>I'm not complaining. You know what they<lf>say, "When life gives you lemons..."
<string>To be honest, I kinda like it and I'm<lf>having a lot of fun doing it, too!
<string>Some of my fellow sailors think we shouldn't<lf>be running these shops.
<string>But to be honest, I'm starting to enjoy<lf>doing this more than bein' on a ship<lf>all the time.
<string>Besides, it's only while we're anchored<lf>here anyway, so why not make a little<lf>zenny on the side?
<string>Heard we're casting off soon? Don't worry<lf>about the ship, maintenance is done and<lf>she's ready to set sail! I did it myself!
<string>In addition to being a sailor, and now<lf>a fruit juice peddler, I'm also one of<lf>the best shipwrights in the biz!
<string>So does the fact that you're back mean<lf>you're finally off on another quest?
<string>I have to admit I'm starting to feel a<lf>little nervous myself. Stop by again when<lf>you've made it back safe and sound.
<string>Hey, you were just talking to the<lf>receptionist...or rather, Princess<lf>Chichae, right? That's so cool!
<string>You see, normally you don't get to see<lf>a princess up close, and you especially<lf>don't get to talk to them...
<string>What's that? There's no way I could talk<lf>to her! I'd be way too nervous! Oh, no!<lf>What if she wants some fruit juice!?
<string>So I heard you're from Kamura,<lf>is that right?
<string>Do you think it's possible that other<lf>hunters from your village will show up<lf>here? I was just wondering...
<string>My dad's a hunter too, though we don't<lf>get along too well... He leaves my mom<lf>alone a lot to go out adventuring.
<string>I couldn't believe I heard the Admiral's<lf>voice all the way over here. Was that<lf>really him? There's no way...
<string>Either way, I just got the Admiral's<lf>favorite fruit in stock. If that WAS<lf>him, maybe it'll cheer him up.
<string>So I heard you've been talking to<lf>Princess Chichae. Did you talk<lf>about anything interesting?
<string>Oh, I wasn't eavesdropping I swear.<lf>I just so happened to look up catch<lf>you two talking while I was working.
<string>The knights and hunters have been<lf>stockpiling food for a while now.<lf>I wonder what's going on...
<string>...Oh, I see. So you're all preparing for<lf>another quest. Now that that's settled,<lf>it's time to restock!
<string>Hey there! I heard the news! Glad<lf>Bahari's safe. He's one of my best...<lf>and weirdest customers.
<string>I've got a whole bunch of unusual items<lf>that only he buys. I was worried they<lf>might go to waste!
<string>Princess Chichae sure does look serious<lf>lately, like she's full of motivation.<lf>I wonder what's up?
<string>...What? No, no! It's not like I make it my<lf>business to watch her or anything. We're<lf>talking about the princess here!
<string>It's just us sailors have a good eye for<lf>these kind of things. Always keepin' a<lf>weathered eye on the horizon we are.
<string>Hey, Hunter! How's your investigation been<lf>going? Making any progress? You have?<lf>I knew it!
<string>You see, whenever things start moving<lf>forward, business picks up dramatically!<lf>It's bananas!
<string>Maybe people are feeling generous.<lf>You could say your success is<lf>helping our shops thrive!
<string>I'm praying for your success, Hunter!<lf>And for mine, too! Speaking of, are<lf>ya interested in a smoothie?
<string>It's been a while since I got to hang out<lf>with Tartar on deck. I hope he's not too<lf>lonely up there.
<string>He's a busy kitty so I'm sure his mind<lf>is occupied but I'm sure deep down<lf>he's feeling a little lonely.
<string>Sorry to ask you, but could you go check<lf>on him every once in a while?
<string>I worked on deck with Tartar the other day.<lf>It was good to hang out with him but we<lf>spent more time scrubbing than hanging...
<string>I swear those seagulls do a number on<lf>the ballistae! And you know the number<lf>I'm talking about! *yuck*
<string>I was thinking about my old man the other<lf>day. He's out there risking his life, fighting<lf>monsters...
<string>And it made me realize. He's putting<lf>his life on the line... And it kinda<lf>worries me, you know?
<string>Talk about sour times... I wish there was<lf>some kind of fruit juice concoction that<lf>I could make into a medicine...
<string>The best I can do is a detox...
<string>Not exactly the poison she needs<lf>flushed from her body...
<string>You're going to the Citadel? It's not much,<lf>but I'll arrange for the Supply Box there to<lf>be stocked with whatever you need.
<string>I really wish I could do more, but as<lf>a member of the research team, it's<lf>all I can do right now.
<string>But you know what? When you return,<lf>I'll treat you to a nice smoothie. How<lf>about that?
<string>We didn't find any sign of Malzeno in the<lf>crater or the surrounding ocean. I didn't<lf>get a chance to use the ballistae either...
<string>But I'm glad, because any situation<lf>where we need to use them won't be<lf>a pretty one.
<string>I wouldn't wish that kind of experience<lf>on anyone, be it you hunters or<lf>my fellow sailors.
<string>I hear the number of Qurio are on the rise.<lf>Perhaps we could catch a couple and<lf>make some zenny on the side?
<string>...Hmm, no idea how we would do it<lf>though. If you come up with any good<lf>ideas, Hunter, send them my way!
<string>Hey, Hunter. You'd better stay clear<lf>of that crane over there.
<string>If it drops its cargo on you, you'll leave<lf>with more than a scratch. That is, if<lf>you're able to leave at all...
<string>Trust me on this one, I've seen it. A while<lf>ago, a hunter who was passing through<lf>was hit and fell into the ocean.
<string>Princess Chichae looks more upset<lf>than usual. I wonder what's the<lf>matter?
<string>Archdemon of the Abyss!? WHAT!?<lf>You mean, I've been standing here<lf>all this time and I'm the last to know!?
<string>You better make it back in one piece,<lf>Hunter. There's still a few things around<lf>here I could use your help with.
<string>I'm not sure if you could see it from where<lf>you were but did you see the Dragonators<lf>in action? Bananas, right?
<string>You know, I actually helped out with those!<lf>It was some of the most rewarding work<lf>I've done in a while. 
<string>I was also glad I could finally be of<lf>help to you and the others. Especially<lf>since you guys were in a squeeze!
<string>If you don't mind me bending the truth<lf>a little, I'm gonna tell my dad I fought<lf>by your side the next time I see him!
<string>All the shops around here started<lf>out as little displays of veggies on<lf>top of boxes.
<string>But then something bananas happened!<lf>We started adding more products and before<lf>long we had all these little shop stands!
<string>Now that business is booming, maybe<lf>they can hire a proper store manager<lf>and I can get back to my real job.
<string>What's that you say? You've never<lf>actually seen me work on a ship?<lf>Well, yeah, I guess you haven't...
<string>Yeah... Ever since the Guild asked me to<lf>run this juice stand, I haven't really had<lf>time for much else. Want a smoothie?
<string>You know, it's been a fun experience<lf>manning this juice stand, and believe<lf>me, I love a free smoothie...
<string>But this ain't the work for me. I'm more<lf>interested in fixing things and keeping<lf>things running.
<string>The only time I ever get to fix something<lf>here is if one of the dispensers breaks...<lf>And I miss bein' on a ship!
<string>But this is only temporary. At least I hope<lf>it is! Don't know if I can spend the rest of<lf>my life squeezin' lemons all day!
<string>You know, Tartar said the darndest<lf>thing the other day. He said I should<lf>open a juice stand on a ship!
<string>I mean, it makes sense. Sailors are<lf>always suffering from a lack of vitamin C.<lf>And it's totally doable! Just imagine!
<string>A monster-huntin', juice-servin' ship!<lf>Fight off monsters and then serve juice<lf>and smoothies! Everybody'd love us!
<string>Remember that crazy idea I was talkin'<lf>about the other day? The one about<lf>the ship?
<string>You know, the more I think about it,<lf>the more I actually want to do it.<lf>Hey, maybe you can join us, too!
<string>You, me, and Tartar! Now that would be<lf>one heck of a crew! Give it some thought,<lf>yeah? There'd be free smoooooothies! ~♪
<string>The Admiral's new ship... Wow! All that<lf>deck space! Do you know how much<lf>juice you could serve on that thing!?
<string>I mean, I know it's bananas to think that<lf>anyone could serve juice on a capital<lf>ship. But it sure is fun to dream!
<string>And besides, I'm gonna build my own<lf>ship one day. I don't care how long it<lf>takes, I'm gonna make it happen!
<string>Of course, I'm gonna need Tartar's help,<lf>too. You think he'd be interested? I mean,<lf>who doesn't like smoothies?
<string>I'm in a bit of squeeze!
<string>Hear me out, now. Please don't laugh, OK?
<string>So there I was, out in the Frost Islands<lf>at night, and then I saw it... A giant, as<lf>big as a mountain, staring at me!
<string>And before I could get anyone's attention,<lf>it disappeared. Now everyone thinks I'm<lf>bananas... I know what I saw, Hunter!
<string>I'm NOT bananas! Please, ya gotta help<lf>me out here. Think you can go out and<lf>get a photo of it? Please!
<string>I knew it! I KNEW IT!
<string>See! SEE! I told them I wasn't crazy!<lf>And now I have proof! Thanks a bunch,<lf>Hunter!
<string>Let's have a look here. Huh. So it wasn't<lf>a giant, but a Monksnail? I've been sailing<lf>a long time and that's a first for me!
<string>Well, the ocean is a crazy place. You<lf>never what you'll see! From now on,<lf>I'm keeping a camera with me!
