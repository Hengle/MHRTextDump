<string>Hey yo, what's up? The name's Hanenaga.<lf>I'm new here in town. I came here to work<lf>as a hunter for hire.
<string>But we can talk about that later. Looks<lf>like you're shopping with the lady, so I'll<lf>let you get back to it.
<string>Yo, Hanenaga's the name, and hunting's<lf>my game.
<string>I came to this lovely village to work as<lf>a hunter, but just because I'm new in<lf>town doesn't mean I'm new to hunting.
<string>So, you're Kamura's new hunter, eh?<lf>I guess that makes you my responsibility.
<string>Well, look. I'm not big into hand-<lf>holding so just follow my lead and<lf>you'll be just fine.
<string>My first day in Kamura, I saw a bunch of<lf>hunters just zipping around on these crazy<lf>wire thingies! I was like, what is going on!?
<string>Almost soiled myself the first time I tried it!<lf>I think I screamed the whole time. But once<lf>you get the hang of it, it's the coolest thing!
<string>Even cooler when it saves you from getting<lf>knocked on your butt! Use it to recover<lf>quickly if a monster sends you flying!
<string>So this Rampage I've been hearing about<lf>is finally coming, eh?
<string>And on top of that, there's some funky<lf>business going down at the Shrine Ruins.<lf>Something about ghosts or spirits?
<string>Normally I'd be packing my bags right<lf>about now but this village has been<lf>good to me.
<string>So this Magnamalo I've been hearing<lf>about is finally coming out to play?
<string>If what they say is true, it feeds on<lf>the monsters in the horde and then<lf>gets all hopped up on the energy.
<string>If we come at it head-on, we're goners<lf>for sure. We're gonna need a plan.
<string>They say that hunting is doing...<lf>And going off to tango with Magnamalo<lf>is a heck of a lot of doing!
<string>Your skills have come a long way—even surpassed<lf>mine. I can't really put into words how amazing<lf>it's been to witness your journey.
<string>The first time we met, I just knew...<lf>There was something about you.<lf>I knew you were destined for greatness.
<string>And now look at you! Outdid just about<lf>every hunter out here—even me!
<string>And I've been hunting for a while now.<lf>Truth is, I haven't gone out on that many<lf>hunts... What can I say? I'm lazy.
<string>But seeing everything that you've<lf>accomplished, it lights a fire in me,<lf>rekindles my passion for the hunt.
<string>Maybe I should get off my butt<lf>and get to hunting again...

<string>Looks like the Rampage is out<lf>in full force, led by something<lf>called an "Apex" Arzuros.
<string>I've never seen anything like it. One<lf>day it's all singing and butterflies,<lf>the next—BAM—Rampage!
<string>Am I the only one worried about<lf>this? Seems like just any other<lf>day in town here...
<string>Maybe, I'm worrying too much.
<string>Oh good, you're safe! I heard<lf>some weird monster showed<lf>up and things got crazy.
<string>And then Hinoa started to, uh—what's it called<lf>again? "Resonate" with it? I'm not even sure<lf>what that means, but I hope she's OK.
<string>The Rampage has been messing<lf>with this village for ages, right?
<string>Maybe it's just me, but it seems like<lf>ever since you became a hunter here,<lf>we're getting closer to ending it.
<string>I'm not superstitious or anything but I'm<lf>starting to believe that maybe fate made<lf>you a hunter to put a stop to the Rampage.
<string>Well the Rampage ain't over yet,<lf>but progress is definitely being<lf>made!
<string>You might make me a believer yet!
<string>Thunder Serpent Narwa...<lf>Ibushi's other half, huh?
<string>Kinda like Rathian and Rathalos.<lf>Well, we've confirmed their existence<lf>at least, and that's progress.
<string>I heard that the dragon had some kinda<lf>hold on Minoto over in the Hub...
<string>What's with these twins here, anyway?
<string>I was floored seeing the people of<lf>Kamura come together. That solidarity's<lf>probably why they survived this long.
<string>These are good people. It pains me<lf>to see them suffer the way they do.<lf>To endure this... I have to do my part.
<string>I'm sure you want that more than<lf>anyone, since you were brought up<lf>here. Fight on, Hunter of Kamura.
<string>A monster's persistence is a frightful<lf>thing for sure, and it seems neither<lf>Narwa or Ibushi are ready to give in yet.
<string>When paired monsters get together, that's<lf>when things get messy. Elder dragons,<lf>even worse. Who knows what'll happen.
<string>I hope we can find those two and take<lf>'em down so we don't find out. It's up<lf>to the twins to guide us to them.

<string>What happens when two elder dragons<lf>meet... Honestly, I'm scared to even think<lf>of the possibilities.
<string>But you're going out there to stop 'em, huh?<lf>...You're really the real deal. Rookie or<lf>not, you've got my respect.
<string>Stay safe out there. And when you get<lf>back, let's go on a hunt together! But,<lf>uh...let's keep it nice and easy, huh?
<string>Seems the whole village is hyped 'bout<lf>being free from the Rampage. And who<lf>can blame 'em? So am I, even...
<string>You know what? I think I like this place.
<string>Might even stay here for good... Heh!
<string>My first day in Kamura, I saw a bunch of<lf>hunters just zipping around on these crazy<lf>wire thingies! I was like, what is going on!?
<string>Almost soiled myself the first time I tried it!<lf>I think I screamed the whole time. But once<lf>you get the hang of it, it's the coolest thing!
<string>Even cooler when it saves you from getting<lf>knocked on your butt! Use it to recover<lf>quickly if a monster sends you flying!
<string>I cannot tell you how much I love using<lf>these kunai thingies. I had never used<lf>them before coming here!
<string>They're just so cool. You can even<lf>reuse them! But you gotta be careful.<lf>Those things can put an eye out!
<string>Ever been to the Training Area? It's just<lf>a short boat ride from the Buddy Plaza.<lf>Make a habit to go in your down time.
<string>If you wanna test something out without<lf>ending up on a cart, that's the place to<lf>do it. They have everything you need.
<string>Wanna practice your counters or<lf>some sweet combos? Check out<lf>the Toadversary! Just one thing...
<string>It's, uh, kinda cute. You'll definitely feel<lf>bad for attacking it. But don't worry, it<lf>can take anything you throw at it!
<string>Have you been using the local wildlife?
<string>Like, some things give you strength when<lf>you get near 'em, others do something if<lf>hit, and others you can catch and use.
<string>I've even heard of some<lf>dropping items when struck<lf>or bringing good fortune.
<string>I heard that some hunters like to go<lf>out into the field with no items and<lf>hunt using only the local wildlife.
<string>"Those who command the wildlife<lf>command the hunt!" ...Or something,<lf>I dunno.
<string>Since the Rampage can strike at any time<lf>without warning, they needed a way for<lf>hunters to mobilize as quickly as possible.
<string>And nothing helps a hunter mobilize faster<lf>than a trusty Palamute. I didn't even know<lf>they were a thing until I came to Kamura!
<string>With Wirebugs and Palamutes, you<lf>can be out of the village and on the<lf>scene in no time! Pretty cool, right?
<string>Of all the skills I've picked up here in<lf>Kamura, wall running is definitely the<lf>most useful. It's seriously cool.
<string>You can climb, run back and forth...<lf>It's the utmost expression of freedom.
<string>Sadly, there's no trick to getting down<lf>easy. When I asked why, people just<lf>said that "falling is faster."
<string>Well, I guess they got a point.
<string>When you use a Wirebug to move<lf>around, it's called <COLS RED>Wiredashing</COL>.
<string>Evade or stop mid-air and hang from your<lf>Wirebug! So many cool things you can do,<lf>no wonder they are so popular with hunters!
<string>I honestly don't know what<lf>I'd do without 'em!
<string>Have you been using Raw Meat on your<lf>hunts? I thought it would be real tricky<lf>to lure monsters out with it at first...
<string>But I decided to toss some out, and<lf>wouldn't you know it, a monster came<lf>running. Maybe I just got lucky though.
<string>You can throw other stuff too, you know.<lf>Small Barrel Bombs, Tranq Bombs, bomb<lf>bombs—uh, well... Scratch that last one.

<string>Y'know, when the hunt gets me exhausted,<lf>I go back to the tent and sleep it off.
<string>Resting there heals up wounds and status<lf>ailments, and even sharpens your weapons.<lf>Pretty sure it's the incense that does that.
<string>So, if you're feeling tired on the hunt,<lf>find a tent. After all, you need a healthy,<lf>well-rested body for a successful hunt.
<string>I saw this odd critter the other day, near<lf>the top of the Shrine Ruins, with this huge<lf>tail. It looked like a...big fox, I guess?
<string>I suppose you're gonna see all kinds<lf>of strange Endemic Life pop up out<lf>in the field.
<string>This species doesn't bite, though—in fact,<lf>if you wave to 'em, they wave back at you.<lf>Try it if you ever see one.
<string>Hey, Hunter! Do you know any cool<lf>Great Wirebug tricks?
<string>I hear you can hop from one Great Wirebug<lf>to another to make your way around... I'm<lf>just too scared to try it out for myself.
<string>You can also use a Midair Evade or<lf>Wiredash just as you're about to hit<lf>the ground, to adjust where you land!
<string>Soar with a Great Wirebug!
<string>You ever heard about them <COLS RED>Great<lf>Wirebug</COL> thingies? Well, they're<lf>pretty much Wirebugs but bigger.
<string>Except their wires're much stronger, meaning<lf>if you hop on one, they'll launch you way,<lf>way farther than a regular ol' Wirebug.
<string>Only catch is, once you set 'em down in<lf>some Jewel Lilies they ain't movin'. And<lf>since they're so big, they're hard to steer.
<string>But once you place one down, you'll be<lf>zippin' all over the place. And they'll be<lf>there when you come back too!
<string>Piqued your interest? Alright, here:<lf>some Great Wirebugs of your very own.<lf>Don't say I ain't never did nothing for ya!
<string>Try it out next time you're on the hunt and<lf>spot some Jewel Lilies. I'm tellin' ya, it'll<lf>make the trekking part a breeze!
<string>Soar with a Great Wirebug!
<string>Oh yo, it's you. Heard you've been doing<lf>pretty well lately! Not that I'd expect any<lf>less from a rookie I took under MY wing.
<string>To help you keep up the good work,<lf>here's some more Great Wirebugs<lf>I caught. Hope you'll find 'em useful.
<string>Hey! You got a minute?
<string>I'm glad you passed by. There's<lf>something I need your help with.
<string>I need to know more about this<lf>creature, the <COLS RED>Rock Lizard</COL>. Think<lf>you can get a picture of it for me?
<string>I mean I could do it myself, but<lf>I've, uh, got other business to<lf>take care of.
<string>Besides, it's good practice for you,<lf>and I'll return the favor. Deal?
<string>Wow! Impressive work!
<string>You got the picture? Great!<lf>Now, lemme take a look...
<string>Amazing! So this is the lizard,<lf>in the stone-cold flesh!
<string>I see, so that's what that part is, and—<lf>ah, yes! This appendage is for THAT!
<string>...Oh, sorry.<lf>Got a little carried away there.<lf>This stuff is so fascinating.
<string>Here, I caught you these <COLS RED>Great Wirebugs</COL>.<lf>Should come in handy during a hunt.
<string>Hey! You got a minute?
<string>"Those who command the wildlife,<lf>command the hunt!" remember? So<lf>knowing your endemic life is crucial.
<string>For a Kamura Hunter especially,<lf>that's must-have knowledge!
<string>And to get it, we need to gather info<lf>on those critters. Care to lend a hand?
<string>Don't worry, I'll make sure you're<lf>well compensated for the work.
<string>Let's start with... You finding<lf>20 different species. Sound good?
<string>Wow! Impressive work!
<string>I had a feeling you'd come through.<lf>Now, let's take a look...
<string>Interesting. I had no idea there's this much<lf>endemic life out there. I'm sure there's even<lf>more waiting to be discovered!
<string>Hey, this one's an eyecatcher! Oh!<lf>And look at this one! Whoa, now<lf>that's really somethin'...
<string>...Oh, sorry.<lf>Got a little carried away there.
<string>Here are some <COLS RED>Great Wirebugs</COL> for your<lf>efforts. Use 'em on your expeditions<lf>to find even more of those critters.
<string>Hey! You got a minute?
<string>An essential for any Kamura Hunter is<lf>knowing how to handle endemic life.
<string>And to do that, we need to gather info<lf>on those critters. Care to lend a hand?
<string>Don't worry, I'll make sure you're<lf>well compensated for the work.
<string>This time, let's go with...finding<lf>30 different species. Sound good?
<string>Wow! Impressive work!
<string>Heh, I expected nothing less from<lf>a Kamura Hunter. Now, let's see...
<string>Well, look at that! So many<lf>different creatures...
<string>Whoa, what's this? And THIS!?<lf>I've never seen them before!<lf>This is great! Fantastic, even!
<string>...Sorry about that.<lf>Got kinda carried away there.
<string>Here're some <COLS RED>Great Wirebugs</COL> for your<lf>trouble. Maybe they'll help you find even<lf>more new and interesting creatures!
<string>Hey! You got a minute?
<string>Have you ever heard a rumor about<lf>some unreal-looking beetle called<lf>a Divine Rhino!?
<string>If it's true, I'd love to see that thing<lf>with my own eyes.
<string>And if anyone can find it, I'll bet<lf>it's you. Think you're up to it?
<string>Wow! Impressive work!
<string>Hey! You caught those beetles<lf>for me!
<string>My pal over at the Guild told me<lf>about 'em and I just had to see<lf>one for myself!
<string>I gotta say, WHOA! Seeing 'em<lf>for real is just amazing.
<string>And now I want to see one out<lf>in the wild in its natural habitat.<lf>That would be incredible!
<string>Anyway, I left Master Hamon and Nakago<lf>some weapon blueprints so you can make<lf>some cool gear. I'm sure you'll find it useful!
