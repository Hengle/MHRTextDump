<string>Ah, I'm starving...<lf>I wonder what's for dinner today.
<string>I consider myself lucky that Kojiri is<lf>always happy to make me dinner.
<string>You should try his cooking sometime!<lf>He's an awesome chef.
<string><NOFAC>A little bit of this~♪<lf>A little bit of that~♪<lf>Ah, <PL>!
<string>Officially a Kamura Hunter, are ya?<lf>That's great! You must be really<lf>proud of yourself. I know I would be!
<string>And since you're a Kamura Hunter, you'll<lf>definitely be taking on Hub quests. That<lf>means I'll be handling all your gear needs!
<string>Although everyone in Kamura seems to<lf>be in the arms trade these days, Kojiri here<lf>and I are Master Hamon's apprentices.
<string>Speaking of Master, that guy is really<lf>something. Whatever it is that you need,<lf>he can whip up at lightning speed!
<string>They say he was an excellent hunter,<lf>back in his day... Is there anything<lf>that man can't do?
<string>I wonder if he's good at cooking. Hm...<lf>For some reason, I feel like he would be.

<string>I wonder if he's good at cooking. Hm...<lf>For some reason, I feel like he would be.
<string>......
<string>Oh, sorry. I got lost in thought<lf>there for a second.
<string>Master Hamon asked me to try and<lf>improve the internal components<lf>used in some of our existing stock.
<string>Can you believe that? Me! I'm honored.<lf>Since then, I've really been throwing<lf>myself into my work.
<string>I heard all about those "Apex" monsters.<lf>An Apex Arzuros, huh? That sounds<lf>like a challenge for sure.
<string>If you need any equipment,<lf>you know where to find me!
<string>We've been really busy these days<lf>because of the Rampage.
<string>Well, "busy." But never as busy<lf>as Master Hamon. I wonder if<lf>that guy even sleeps!
<string>He's been at it day and night, and<lf>I think he's even been taking on<lf>some of our own work, too.
<string>Seeing him like this stresses me out—<lf>I worry he's gonna keel over from<lf>too much work.
<string>I'm so hungry... I wonder what<lf>Kojiri packed for lunch today?
<string>Don't you get excited when you open up<lf>your lunchbox? I love seeing so many nice<lf>things neatly packed into one little box.
<string>Kojiri's lunchboxes always look<lf>delicious, but that doesn't even<lf>come close to how good they taste!
<string>Looks like lunch today is rice balls.<lf>I wonder what's inside them? My mouth<lf>is watering just thinking about 'em!
<string>Come to think of it, when you're out<lf>hunting, you must feel the same way<lf>about your gear, right?
<string>Like when your draw your sword<lf>or load your bowgun with new ammo?
<string>...Or maybe not. Please, ignore my<lf>rambling.
<string>Ha! I knew it was you, <PL><lf>I could hear you clomping up the stairs!<lf>Going out to take on the Wind Serpent?
<string>All your armor and weaponry<lf>good to go? Anything special<lf>I can help you out with?
<string>How strange that the Rampage<lf>still isn't letting up...
<string>Could it be that the Wind Serpent isn't<lf>the only cause of the Rampage?
<string>I don't know what might happen now...<lf>But you can bet your bowguns I'll make sure<lf>the villagers are armed to the teeth!
<string>Is it true about those monsters?<lf>I heard both Narwa AND Ibushi<lf>are BOTH behind the Rampage.
<string>Seems like they're looking for each<lf>other, and if they find each other...
<string>You know what? I'm not even gonna think<lf>about it. I'm just gonna concentrate on making<lf>sure everyone has the gear they need!
<string>Looks like it's almost time. Are you<lf>nervous, <PL>? I know I'd be...
<string>Kojiri would probably get mad if I said it,<lf>but knowing you, you'll be just fine.
<string>... Just between you and me, OK? Hehehe.
<string>I heard the news, <PL>.<lf>I can't believe they're both still alive!<lf>Those two just won't quit, will they!?
<string>I'm not too worried though. I know<lf>you'll be able to bring 'em down as many<lf>times as it takes, <PL>.
<string>Just make sure you got the right gear<lf>for the job. And you know where to<lf>find me if you need anything!
<string>The cherry blossoms look<lf>so beautiful today.
<string>We might as well relax and enjoy<lf>them while they're in bloom. Might<lf>even bust out a bottle of something—
<string>And...Kojiri doesn't like that idea.<lf>I said nothing. I said nothing. Hehehe.
<string>Welcome, <PL>! Time for<lf>the ol' elder dragon reunion, huh?
<string>I've got so much stuff I need to do, but<lf>I can't help but feel nervous constantly...
<string>OK, this calls for some deep breathing.<lf>Come on, you too! Ready?<lf>Iiiin... Ouuut...
<string>The Rampage is finally coming to an end,<lf>thanks to you... Man, I'm beside myself<lf>with gratitude, honestly.
<string>That means Kamura's gonna be back<lf>to its old busy self—and I'm gonna<lf>have a whole lotta work to do!
<string>Ah, I'm starving...<lf>I wonder what's for dinner today.
<string>I consider myself lucky that Kojiri is<lf>always happy to make me dinner.
<string>You should try his cooking sometime!<lf>He's an awesome chef.
<string>I have such a sweet tooth. I'm always<lf>craving something sweet. How about you,<lf><PL>?
<string>The other day I was cooking and threw<lf>a bunch of sugar in it. Uh, maybe a little<lf>too much actually.
<string>It was so dang sweet that I wasn't<lf>even able to eat it.
<string>I thought I'd have to throw it away,<lf>but Kojiri took over and made it<lf>edible again, just like that!
<string>He worked his little magic and<lf>*boom* it was delicious. Man,<lf>Kojiri really is a good cook.
<string>I was watching Kojiri cook the other<lf>day. I tried to help, but I got shut<lf>down pretty fast...
<string>He made this cool, stretchy dough, just<lf>by mixing flour and water! I think then<lf>he cut it up and steamed the pieces...
<string>But before I knew it, he'd cut up some<lf>veggies and fried them, and he'd already<lf>made rice, too! How does he do that?
<string>He managed to make so many dishes at<lf>once... I was watching the whole time,<lf>but I just don't get how he does it.
<string>Maybe there's more than one Kojiri...?<lf>No, that wouldn't make sense at all.
<string>Salt and sugar look the same, right?<lf>So it's super easy to get them confused!
<string>Once, I was cooking and meant to use<lf>sugar, but I accidentally used salt<lf>instead, so it tasted suuuper gross.
<string>But when I told Kojiri, he came<lf>home the next day with some<lf>brown-colored sugar.
<string>Brown sugar! They really think of<lf>everything. Now I'll never make that<lf>mistake again! Kojiri sure is great.
<string>The other day, I was sharpening our<lf>kitchen knives. They've gotten really<lf>dull recently.
<string>It was really fun, actually. I think<lf>I've been in this job too long. Imagine<lf>that, having fun sharpening knives!
<string>I thought I'd done a pretty good job,<lf>but then Kojiri freaked out and yelled<lf>at me.
<string>Uh, apparently, kitchen knives aren't<lf>supposed to be as sharp as weapons...<lf>How was I supposed to know that!?
<string>Anyway, I had sharpened them so well,<lf>they cut right through the cutting<lf>board AND the kitchen table... Oops.
<string>Fish are so delicious, but scaling them<lf>is such a pain in the Astalos...
<string>So, I made a little gizmo that helps<lf>you do it. I got the inspiration from<lf>one of Master Hamon's creations.
<string>All you have to do is put the fish<lf>on the mount, and then the machine<lf>does the rest of the work!
<string>And it's efficient, too. It can<lf>descale three fish at a time!
<string>Useful, right? Kojiri seemed<lf>really pleased with it.

<string>Hey, get a load of this!
<string><NOFAC>Well now, it's <PL>!<lf>What's up? Having any gear issues?
<string>When you're feeling light on defense,<lf>I recommend <COLS RED>upgrading your armor</COL>.<lf>It'll boost its capabilities.
<string><COLS RED>Armor spheres</COL> are needed to upgrade<lf>armor, so if you have some burning<lf>a hole in your pocket, come see me!
<string>You know what... I'll share a couple armor<lf>spheres of my own with you; go ahead<lf>and try upgrading something with them!

<string>Hey, get a load of this!
<string><NOFAC><PL>! I have some big news<lf>for you.
<string>Master Hamon's been hard at work<lf>developing a new form of weapon<lf>upgrade! It's called <COLS RED>Ramping-Up</COL>.
<string>It uses special materials from<lf>the Rampage to empower weapons<lf>way beyond any normal upgrade!
<string>If you can get your hands on one of<lf>these upgrades, it's sure to give you<lf>an edge. Try it—I know you want to!

<string>Well, we smiths're not about to be<lf>outdone! We can now forge special<lf>weapons called <COLS RED>Rampage Weapons</COL>.
<string>All that's needed are materials from<lf>an Apex monster. For whatever reason, they take<lf>really well to Ramping-Up as a weapon!
<string>We make them just like other things we've<lf>forged in the past. Come check it out;<lf>they're our finest works yet!
<string>Hey, get a load of this!
<string><NOFAC>I've got some good news, <PL>!<lf>We're finally able to forge <COLS RED>decorations</COL>!
<string>They're great for giving your equipment a skill<lf>boost. Use the Decorations menu in your Item<lf>Box or the one here at the Smithy.
<string>You'll need <COLS RED>jewels</COL> to forge them,<lf>so please bring some with you<lf>whenever you want any made.
<string>We're working around the clock to come up<lf>with new decorations, so stop by<lf>whenever you can!
<string>Hey, get a load of this!

<string>We're all set up to start forging <COLS RED>layered<lf>armor</COL>! It lets you change the look of your<lf>regular gear without affecting functionality.
<string>Actually, I was the one who pushed for<lf>us to start making 'em, and it's finally<lf>happened! Not bad on my part, huh?
<string>You'll need outfit vouchers to get started,<lf>but I'm so eager to see what you'll do—<lf>here, take these and try it out!
