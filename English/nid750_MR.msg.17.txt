<string>Welcome back, <PL>.
<string>Hehehe, did I surprise you? No, you're<lf>not seeing things, silly! I'm really here<lf>in Elgado.
<string>The energy here is quite incredible. And<lf>there are so many new things to see!<lf>It's all exciting!
<string>I think I'll start with some shopping.<lf>And some decent food, after that voyage!<lf>Can you point me to the Bunny Dango?
<string>It seems Minoto hasn't fully adjusted to<lf>Elgado. She's a delicate flower...<lf>Quite unlike me.
<string>It might have been unkind of me to drag<lf>her out here. Although she doesn't seem<lf>to hate it. Not exactly.
<string><PL>.<lf>When you have a moment, please do<lf>chat with us too!
<string>I'm sure seeing your face will help put<lf>Minoto at ease.
<string>I heard that Chichae, the cute little quest<lf>receptionist, is the Kingdom's princess!
<string>Which means it's time to reveal our own<lf>secret! Quest Maidens? Just a cover! We<lf>sisters are actually... Wyverian royalty!
<string>Gotcha! Hehehe. I'm just joking around.<lf>We're Hinoa and Minoto, and nothing<lf>else. Got nervous there, didn't ya!?
<string><PL>!<lf>Thank goodness you're safe!
<string>I heard that Malzeno attacked you,<lf>and Lady Fiorayne was injured while<lf>trying to protect the research team...
<string>A minor wound is still a wound.<lf>Be careful out there and keep an<lf>eye on each other!

<string><VO:SER>I heard Fiorayne fell ill, so I called<lf>Rondine— *ahem* so I called Dame<lf>Rondine here from Kamura.
<string>Someone else can handle her duties,<lf>but Lady Fiorayne only has one sister.
<string>I hope she gets well soon. For her<lf>sister's sake as well as her own.

<string>It seems no matter where I go, I hear<lf>tales of your deeds, <PL>!<lf>Aren't you amazing!?
<string>Everyone's singing your praises.<lf>It makes me very proud.
<string>But I know people here haven't<lf>seen the half of it yet!
<string>I want everyone to understand just<lf>how amazing you really are.
<string>So I was thinking I could sing a song<lf>about you for all to hear!<lf>...Wouldn't you like that?
<string>......
<string>Oh, I'm so sorry, <PL>.<lf>I was miles away.
<string>I have butterflies in my stomach. Just<lf>like before the Rampage. It feels as<lf>though something's about to happen...
<string>I wonder if it's this weather...<lf>Hopefully, it turns out to be nothing,<lf>but I don't know...
<string>Oh, hello, <PL>! You seem<lf>so busy. I hope you're not overdoing it?
<string>I'm delighted and proud that you've been<lf>sought out by the Kingdom because of<lf>your talents.
<string>But every now and then I do wish there<lf>was time for us to have a cup of tea.
<string>No doubt I'd get in trouble for monopolizing<lf>the Kingdom's new national hero, but still...
<string>I can cope with a little trouble.<lf>So how about some tea?
<string>When I found out I'd be heading to Elgado,<lf>I ordered a whole heap of dango from the<lf>Tea Shop.
<string>I had to order enough for the journey to<lf>Elgado, some for the time spent in Elgado,<lf>and more for the journey back to Kamura.
<string>There's no way I could have made the trip<lf>without Bunny Dango.
<string>But then I remembered that Azuki had<lf>opened a Tea Shop in Elgado.
<string>So in the end, I only ordered sixty orders of<lf>dango for the trip here. Phew! Thank heavens<lf>I avoided bringing too much luggage!
<string>So, <PL>, what do you think<lf>of the Bunny Dango here?
<string>I was so happy to have some of Azuki's<lf>dango again after such a long time<lf>that I ordered twice as many as usual.
<string>I did worry that I might have ordered too<lf>much, but once I started eating them,<lf>I just couldn't stop! Hehehe.
<string>Elgado is a wonderful place, it really is!<lf>I'm so happy to be here!
<string>I guess the way I dress is quite unusual<lf>here. Lots of people have commented<lf>on my clothes.
<string>And when I say I'm from Kamura Village,<lf>they all start talking about you.
<string>It feels strange hearing things about you<lf>from people who aren't from Kamura.
<string>Sometimes I tell them stories about you<lf>from your childhood in return, and<lf>they're all delighted! Hehehe.
<string>I got to talk to Bahari the other day! He<lf>came by and asked me to tell him all<lf>about the Rampage.
<string>He had so many questions! Like how<lf>the Rampage is linked to Kamura, and<lf>how we've defended against it.
<string>About the damage it's done, the Stronghold,<lf>things we've engineered to tackle it, and<lf>about you, of course.
<string>I answered as best I could, but his<lf>questions got very...technical. I was<lf>super hungry afterwards! Hehehe.
<string>I really think he ought to be asking<lf>Elder Fugen or Master Hamon, not me.
<string>Perhaps I'll suggest that he writes them<lf>about it. Although I expect it'll result<lf>in some very long...long letters!
<string>I enjoy dango with a view of the cherry<lf>blossoms in Kamura. But they're just as<lf>tasty with a view of the sea in Elgado.
<string>Different places, but the same great<lf>taste. It's all thanks to the chefs.<lf>I'm so grateful to them.
<string>You know, I did this thing before where<lf>I gave dango away to people here in<lf>Elgado to enjoy with me. As publicity.
<string>I gave one away, had one myself.<lf>Gave another away, had three myself.<lf>Gave another away, had five myself...
<string>I think it was seeing everyone enjoying<lf>them that made me eat more. Then<lf>the dango were gone and it was over...
<string>Hmmm. I think next time I'll have to buy<lf>a LOT more! Hehehe.
<string>Your brave deeds are the talk of the Guild<lf>again, <PL>.
<string>It's going to mean lots of other places<lf>around the world will be vying for your<lf>assistance, I'm sure.
<string>But don't worry. I'll visit you wherever<lf>you are!
<string>I'm sure Minoto will, too. And as for<lf>Master Utsushi, well...that goes<lf>without saying!
