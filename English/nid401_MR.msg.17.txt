<string>Hi there, <PL>, here to<lf>train? Or did you just come to say goodbye?
<string>When you're not meow-t there being a<lf>su-purrstar hunter I hope you remember<lf>all the hard work you put in here...
<string>Why not squeeze in a quick session<lf>before you head out? Meow's as good<lf>a time as any, wouldn't you say?
<string>I heard there's no Training Area meow-t<lf>in Elgado.
<string>So does that mean you'll be coming<lf>back here when you're feline the need<lf>to purr-actice?
<string>Well, the facilities here are always open<lf>for you to use! And any Elgado furr-iends<lf>you want to bring along are welcome to!
<string>A mew instructor named Arlow started<lf>coming to the Arena recently.
<string>He's actually visited several times.<lf>And then the other day he stopped<lf>by the Training Area.
<string>"Nice facilities you've got here, yeah?"<lf>he mew-sed...
<string>Ain't that something!? To think even word<lf>of my beloved Training Area has reached<lf>the Kingdom!
<string>And if su-purr cool people like Arlow keep<lf>showing up, that's sure to attract more<lf>visitors! I wonder if I should make a poster...
<string>Welcome back, <PL>!
<string>Kogarashi told me you've been working<lf>your tail off over in Elgado.
<string>Hearing everyone sing your purr-raises<lf>makes a Felyne feel mighty fine. And<lf>it gives me an idea!
<string>"'<PL>, the Fierce' shed blood,<lf>sweat, and tears to become a hunter,<lf>right in this very Training Area!"
<string>Got a nice ring to it, yeah? Now i-meow-gine<lf>it on billboards all over the Kingdom! Eh? EH!?<lf>*nudge nudge*
<string>Oh, <PL>... *snicker*<lf>The funniest thing *snicker* happened<lf>the other day. *snort*
<string>You know how Meowster Utsushi is<lf>always purr-acticing his meownster<lf>im-purr-essions, right?
<string>Well, the other day, Shirubei came by right<lf>when Meowster Utsushi let out a huge roar<lf>and the poor kitten almost keeled over.
<string>And I almost keeled over laughing! I mean,<lf>I hear Utsushi going at it all the time, so<lf>it's nothing mew to me. Still...
<string>I feel bad for poor Shirubei. Maybe<lf>I oughta go a-paw-logize to him...
<string>Heeeeeey! Look who it is!<lf>"<PL>, the Fierce - Savior of<lf>Kamura AND the Kingdom"!
<string>"Even after leaving the village, a hero<lf>never forgets their roots. Come to the<lf>Training Area to maintain your edge!"
<string>What do you think!? I've already ordered<lf>the fur-st batch of T-shirts! They're sure to<lf>be a big hit!
