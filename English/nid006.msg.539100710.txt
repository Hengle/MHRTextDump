<string>O-Oh, <PL>!<lf>I see you're out shopping with Hinoa!
<string>Sure wish I could go shopping<lf>with her someday...
<string>Hey, <PL>!<lf>I heard you're a hunter now.<lf>Congratulations!
<string>With the Rampage on the way,<lf>Master Hamon's real busy.
<string>Which means my apprenticeship<lf>is on hold for now...
<string>Well, with all this free time I can<lf>focus on mustering up the courage<lf>to talk to my beloved Hinoa.
<string>Oh, Hinoa, shining light of all<lf>Kamura. My ray of sunshine—uh...<lf>Sh-She can't hear me, can she!?
<string>Master Hamon says my training<lf>will have to wait while he's working<lf>on the Rampage stuff. *sigh*
<string>Well, I guess I have more time<lf>to psych myself up so I can talk<lf>to my beloved Hinoa...
<string>Wish I could be more useful around<lf>here though... You'll let me know if<lf>you find something for me, won't you?
<string>Hey there, <PL>!<lf>How's the hunter's life treating ya?
<string>Me? I'm just sitting here twiddling<lf>my thumbs, since Master's too busy<lf>to teach me anything.
<string>*sigh* While I'm doing nothing,<lf>maybe I ought to try my hand<lf>at becoming a hunter like you!
<string>Come to think of it, taking on quests<lf>would be the perfect opportunity to<lf>talk to my beloved Hinoa!
<string>Wait, no. Bad idea! I would freeze up<lf>like a dummy if I even tried to look<lf>her in the eyes. Man, I'm pathetic...
<string>Oh, no! My poor Hinoa's panicked<lf>because they stopped selling Bunny<lf>Dango.
<string>Agh! Darn you, Bunny Dango!<lf>How I envy your ability to<lf>move Hinoa's heart so!
<string>...Hey, maybe I should apprentice<lf>under Yomogi in the meantime,<lf>learn how to make them.
<string>Come to think of it, selling dango<lf>would be the perfect opportunity<lf>to talk to my beloved Hinoa!
<string>Wait, no. Terrible idea! I could never<lf>make Bunny Dango good enough<lf>to serve Hinoa! Man, I'm useless...
<string>Hey, <PL>!<lf>I heard it was you that helped out<lf>Iori. You've been busy, huh?
<string>You probably can't tell from Master<lf>Hamon's steely look, but this is the<lf>happiest he's been in years!
<string>Hey there, <PL>.<lf>The Rampage—it's finally here!
<string>I was planning on focusing my efforts<lf>here, but now I've decided I'm gonna<lf>protect the village at the Stronghold.
<string>Why? Well, I heard that my beloved<lf>Hinoa will be defending the village<lf>over there, so I gotta go too.
<string>Don't worry about me. I've trained<lf>well and hard for times like these.
<string>Imagining Hinoa struggling to<lf>protect Kamura from encroaching<lf>monsters makes for great prep!
<string><PL>!<lf>I heard you got attacked by some<lf>crazy monster. I was super worried!
<string>Iori was with you, right? Master<lf>Hamon was all kinds of beside<lf>himself with grandfatherly worry.
<string>I think he's planning something<lf>for that monster. His eyes are<lf>looking more steely than usual.
<string>Master Hamon took those<lf>Bishaten parts and finished up<lf>his contraption in no time.
<string>He really is a master craftsman!<lf>Hinoa was real impressed too.
<string>I'm gonna train night and day<lf>so I can become a first-rate<lf>blacksmith like him someday.
<string>Then maybe then my beloved<lf>Hinoa will notice me!
<string>Time to take on Magnamalo, huh?
<string>Even when you are in danger, it seems to put<lf>my beloved Hinoa at ease. I wish there was<lf>something *I* could do to put her at ease...
<string>Anyway, the whole village<lf>feels the same. We're all<lf>counting on you!
<string>Did Elder Fugen really give you his<lf>sword for defeating Magnamalo!?
<string>Whoa! That thing's been given to the<lf>leader of Kamura for generations!<lf>Master says it holds "untold power."
<string>Heh. It doesn't look like much to<lf>me...but if Master says so, who<lf>am I to disagree?
<string>That serene smile, that avaricious<lf>appetite for dango!
<string>Ah, they bring me joy even to observe<lf>from afar! My beloved Hinoa never<lf>ceases to brighten my days!
<string>I'm going to use this energy to<lf>train so one day, I can become a<lf>first-rate blacksmith like Master!
<string>Wait—but, if we don't stop the Rampage,<lf>Master will never have time to train me!
<string>It gets me so worked up, and yet<lf>I can't do anything. It's so annoying!<lf>Can this Rampage thing go away already!?
<string>Some nights, Master Hamon goes<lf>drinking with Elder Fugen and<lf>Master Hojo at the Hub.
<string>They were Kamura's best hunters in their<lf>youth, and they're still fast friends.
<string>Gah! They're all so cool!<lf>I wanna be like that someday!
<string>When we grow old, let's spend<lf>our nights drinking at the Hub too!

<string>When we grow old, let's spend<lf>our nights drinking at the Hub too!
<string>Hey there, <PL>!<lf>I heard there's a Rampage quest at the<lf>Gathering Hub to take down an Apex monster!
<string>Forgive me, I should say that I'm worried for<lf>your well-being but all I can think about is<lf>my beloved Hinoa. Something is not right...
<string>She's not her usual chipper self. She<lf>seems so uneasy about something.<lf>I want to help her, but...
<string>I can't even muster the courage to talk<lf>to her much less go and cheer her up...<lf>WHY AM I SO USELESS!? UGH!
<string>Is Hinoa alright!? I heard she collapsed<lf>from "resonating" or something!
<string>That fiendish dragon that hurt Hinoa...<lf>It makes me angry in a way I've never<lf>felt before.
<string>But what can I do!? I'm so useless—<lf><PL>! You must take that<lf>beast down for my beloved Hinoa!
<string>Hinoa's better now...<lf>Or, at least, she seems better.
<string>She's smiling again. At least, smiling<lf>in between mouthfuls of dango!<lf>Kamura seems like its old self.
<string>Even so, we still don't know<lf>what that dragon really is...<lf>Really casts a shadow on it all.
<string>Hey there, <PL>!<lf>I heard about the azure dragon!
<string>If you get rid of Ibushi, then Hinoa<lf>will be OK! And the Rampage will<lf>end too! It's so simple!
<string>Alright, let's do this!<lf>Bring it on, Ibushi!
<string>Time to take down Ibushi.
<string>You don't have to worry about the<lf>Stronghold or Hinoa, because I'll<lf>be defending both until the very end!
<string>Let's show 'em what Kamura can do!
<string>You went through all that trouble<lf>to deal with Ibushi, but the Rampage<lf>still rages...
<string>Well, at least Hinoa is free from that<lf>weird trance. Silver linings and all, right?
<string>So, wait... The dragon Hinoa<lf>resonated with had a "queen"<lf>and Minoto resonated with IT!?
<string>I'm lost here... This is making my<lf>head hurt worse than listening to<lf>Master's hammer... Ugh.
<string>Anyway, it's not important. All<lf>I need to know is if we get rid<lf>of it, the Rampage is done for.
<string>The Guild has chosen you.
<string>Go knock that stupid monster<lf>down a few pegs!
<string>So, now Hinoa and Minoto are both<lf>resonating with those dragons?
<string>Ibushi and Narwa, they just don't<lf>give up. Guess they really can cause<lf>something crazy like the Rampage.
<string>If those two were to join forces,<lf>things could get worse. We have<lf>to find them and stop, quick!

<string>Hey, <PL>!<lf>So, you're finally off to go put an end<lf>to Ibushi and Narwa, once and for all!
<string>Listen—if you get hurt, it's gonna make Hinoa<lf>real sad. So look after yourself out there,<lf>or else you're gonna have to answer to me!
<string>Now that the Rampage is gone, Kamura's<lf>bustle is coming back, and Hinoa is more<lf>beautiful and radiant than ever!
<string>Oh, Hinoa, shining light of all<lf>Kamura. My ray of sunshine—uh...<lf>Sh-She can't hear me, can she!?
<string>Master Hamon says my training<lf>will have to wait while he's working<lf>on the Rampage stuff. *sigh*

<string>Wish I could be more useful around<lf>here though... You'll let me know if<lf>you find something for me, won't you?
<string>Hey, <PL>! So you took<lf>down that Great Izuchi, right? I bet dealing<lf>with monsters can be a real pain sometimes...
<string>But it always gets my creative juices<lf>going when I think about how you<lf>hunters are using our gear out there.
<string>Like, maybe a little tweak here will increase<lf>swinging speed. Or a tweak there will improve<lf>your grip on the handle. Stuff like that!
<string>Mechanically complex weapons<lf>like switch axes and charge blades<lf>are nice and all,
<string>but personally, I prefer making simple<lf>weapons that make direct use of<lf>a hunter's strength, like hammers.
<string>Not only are they easy to make,<lf>but crafting each part to maximize<lf>the weapon's full brute potential...
<string>When I think about it, I get really<lf>excited and it keeps me up all night.
<string><PL>, have you<lf>seen Hinoa use a bow?
<string>It's pure mastery in action. If she were<lf>to become a hunter, I think she'd jump<lf>right to the high-tier quests.
<string>She can shoot for days, and<lf>the beautiful way she moves<lf>almost looks like she's dancing.
<string>I want to make a bow worthy<lf>of Hinoa... That's one thing<lf>that fuels my passion.
<string>Hinoa's skill with a bow is masterful,<lf>but Minoto's with a lance...<lf>That approaches genius.
<string>She draws her lance so quickly;<lf>blink and you'll miss it.
<string>And she leaves no opening for<lf>attack, making the utmost use<lf>of the lance's length.
<string>Those sisters really are quite the pair!
<string>I spent some time training outside<lf>Kamura Village for a while, once,<lf>going from blacksmith to blacksmith.
<string>But there are none who come close<lf>to Master Hamon. I've never seen<lf>anyone else work steel like he does.
<string>He'd be in high demand if he left<lf>the village, but he doesn't care to.<lf>That's why he's our Master, I guess.
<string>Nice one, <PL>!
<string>I heard you got it, <PL>!<lf>Magnamalo? More like Magna-mild, heh!<lf>And Hinoa's smiling more than ever!
<string>You're my hero! So, as a sign of my<lf>thanks, I wanna give you this armor!<lf>...Uh, it's for a Cohoot though.
<string>This <COLS RED>Rugged Fullsuit</COL> completely neglects<lf>any sort of functionality in favor of style!<lf>Your Cohoot is gonna love it!
<string>Come back later, and I'll have some more<lf>armor ready that will blow your mind!
<string>I'll get right on it!
<string>This way, quick!
<string>You're on fire!
