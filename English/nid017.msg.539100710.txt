<string>Oh, <PL>!<lf>*munch munch*<lf>How are *munch* you?
<string>I'm actually gettin' some *munch*<lf>grub right now. You should go on<lf>shopping with Hinoa!
<string>I heard you became an official<lf>Hunter of Kamura!
<string>I started studying under Master Utsushi<lf>so I can become a hunter myself!<lf>I'm like, trainin' real hard!
<string>Hey, since you've been training under Master<lf>Utsushi longer than me, is it OK if I call you<lf>Chief? That sounds cool, right!?
<string>Master Utsushi says meals are<lf>the foundation of a good hunter—<lf>especially Bunny Dango.
<string>So, I've been going to the Tea Shop<lf>to learn a couple things about<lf>Bunny Dango from Yomogi.
<string>She says the combination of dango<lf>changes what they do for a hunt.<lf>Man, dango are just so...deep!
<string>I'm studyin' hard to become a hunter<lf>under Master Utsushi!
<string>Master Utsushi says I should<lf>concentrate on eatin' a lot<lf>and sleepin' a lot.
<string>So I'm gonna eat and eat n' keep<lf>eatin', and then I'm gonna sleep<lf>'til my eyes don't shut anymore!
<string>Hey, Chief! How's the hunting life?<lf>Me, I've been training really hard so<lf>I can be a hunter just like you!
<string>I also jog to the Training Area<lf>via the Buddy Plaza: a perfect<lf>regimen for gettin' in shape.
<string>Hey, uh, is it true that there're<lf>ghosts in the Shrine Ruins!?
<string>What? Am I scared?<lf>N-No, of course not!
<string>I'm tryin' to become a hunter here!<lf>I've got no time to be spooked<lf>by fairytales! Haha...ha...

<string>I'm tryin' to become a hunter here!<lf>I've got no time to be spooked<lf>by fairytales! Haha...ha...
<string>Finally, the Rampage's here! I'd love to<lf>be at the Stronghold with everyone else,<lf>but I got told I'm too young to fight...
<string>Ugh, I hate bein' a kid! I wanna<lf>be a hunter so I can help protect<lf>the village too!
<string>I heard you got attacked by some<lf>fearsome monster! Glad everyone<lf>was OK, though!
<string>There'll be tons of scary lookin'<lf>monsters coming to the village<lf>with this Rampage thing, huh?
<string>I wish I could be a hunter right now<lf>so I can help protect the village too!
<string>Master Utsushi took me to<lf>the Shrine Ruins the other day!
<string>I got to see so many monsters,<lf>I've never been so excited in my<lf>whole entire life!
<string>I'm gonna keep studyin', keep trainin'<lf>and become one heckuva hunter one day!<lf>You'll see!
<string>Chief, I heard you're gonna go<lf>fight Magnamalo!
<string>Master Utsushi said that if there's<lf>anyone who can defeat it, it's you...
<string>And I believe it! I'll be there to see you<lf>stand tall in victory!
<string>Master Utsushi's been teachin'<lf>me every day about becoming<lf>a great hunter!
<string>He says there's nothing more<lf>important than eatin' plenty<lf>and sleepin' plenty!
<string>"Eating and sleeping are fundamental<lf>to all animals. Any hunter unable to<lf>do that right is simply unfit to hunt."
<string>Man, everything the Master<lf>says is always so deep!

<string>Hey, Chief!<lf>Heard you started takin' on Hub quests!
<string>Testing your strength on solo hunts<lf>is cool, but workin' together with<lf>other hunters sounds pretty cool too!
<string>When I become a hunter,<lf>I wanna go out on a hunt<lf>alongside you, Chief!
<string>Hey, Chief!<lf>Have you ever seen Master Utsushi<lf>do his monster impressions?
<string>Oh boy, the stuff he does is so<lf>accurate! Especially his Zinogre<lf>impression. It's almost TOO real!
<string>And I get to do mock hunts with<lf>Master Utsushi playing the monster!<lf>Super educational 'n stuff, right?

<string>Hey, Chief, off to fight the Rampage?
<string>Wish I could go to help with defense,<lf>but being a trainee, I gotta stay home.
<string>So I'll eat plenty and sleep plenty like<lf>Master Utsushi said, and wait for<lf>you guys to come home safe!
<string>The Rampage is where a bunch of<lf>monsters attack in a group, right?
<string>That doesn't make sense...<lf>Monsters fight for territory, or<lf>try to eat each other, usually.
<string>Why would they come attackin' together?<lf>Are they being controlled or somethin'?

<string>Why would they come attackin' together?<lf>Are they being controlled or somethin'?
<string>Monsters fight for territory, or<lf>try to eat each other, usually.<lf>But not with the Rampage...
<string>All because they're just trying to<lf>get away from a scary dragon.
<string>And then, we get caught up in<lf>the panic and call it a "Rampage."<lf>...Did I get all of that right?
<string>Yeah, now it all makes sense!<lf>Man, beatin' that dragon is<lf>gonna be a real pain, though.
<string>Heya, Chief!<lf>Now you get to go n' beat<lf>that Wind Serpent, Ibushi!
<string>You can do it!<lf>Everyone's believin' in you!
<string>I'm a trainee and a kid n' all, so I'm<lf>not allowed to go to the Stronghold.<lf>You gotta tell me what happened later!
<string>Wow! Just...wow!<lf>You sent Ibushi runnin'!
<string>I'm gonna keep trainin' like crazy,<lf>and become one heckuva hunter<lf>someday, just like you!
<string>I think I got a little bigger recently!<lf>Everyone around me keeps saying,<lf>"Hey, kid, you've gotten taller."
<string>Must be thanks to Master Utsushi's<lf>advice to "eat plenty and sleep plenty!"
<string>I'm gonna keep eatin' and sleepin'<lf>and get even bigger. Then I'll be a<lf>hunter helping the village in no time!
<string>You're going out there, Chief?
<string>I've still got lots I wanna learn<lf>from you as a hunter, so...<lf>Come back safe, OK?
<string>I heard that Ibushi and Narwa are<lf>both still alive somewhere.<lf>They got guts, I'll give 'em that.
<string>Hey, if it'll take decades to find 'em,<lf>don't worry. 'Cause by then, I'll be<lf>a hunter and get 'em for you!
<string>So you can go ahead and<lf>retire whenever you like!
<string>When I grow up, I wanna be<lf>a hunter like you: someone who<lf>everyone can feel safe around.
<string>That means I gotta be good at hunting<lf>AND nice and friendly to everyone.<lf>Those are pretty big shoes to fill, but...
<string>I'll do my best to follow<lf>your example, Chief!
<string>This is it then, huh, Chief?
<string>I couldn't make my secret goal to graduate<lf>from "novice" status before those two<lf>dragons were found come true, but...
<string>You're gonna teach 'em a lesson for me,<lf>right, Chief? And while you're doing that,<lf>I'll be here to keep the village safe! Heheh!
<string>Oh boy! You're amazing, Chief! I mean,<lf>you're the hero who put an end to<lf>Kamura's historic calamity 'n' stuff!
<string>I dunno if I can catch up to that level of<lf>greatness for a while, but best to aim high,<lf>right? ...Man, I gotta start working harder!
<string>Master Utsushi says meals are<lf>the foundation of a good hunter—<lf>especially Bunny Dango.
<string>So, I've been going to the Tea Shop<lf>to learn a couple things about<lf>Bunny Dango from Yomogi.
<string>She says the combination of dango<lf>changes what they can do for a hunt.<lf>Man, dango are just so...deep!

<string>As a hunter-to-be of Kamura Village<lf>and all, I guess I better get used<lf>to using Wirebugs, right?
<string>Except I can't make 'em fly where<lf>I want. It must be 'cause I don't<lf>have the skills or the bug's trust.
<string>Master Utsushi says I gotta "learn<lf>by doing," so I'll keep on practicing<lf>'til I get the hang of it!

<string>When I become a hunter, I'm gonna<lf>have to go to the quest counter to<lf>receive quests, just like everyone else.
<string>And Master Utsushi said being "proactive"<lf>was super important, so I went to Hinoa<lf>and Minoto to start practicin' gettin' quests.
<string>B-But, I dunno... When I went to talk<lf>to them, my heart started beatin' fast,<lf>and my tongue got tied up.
<string>Man, I guess I'm not there yet.<lf>I'll have to train super hard so I can<lf>talk to ladies without freezin' up!
