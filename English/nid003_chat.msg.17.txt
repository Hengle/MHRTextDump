<string>The Rampage is at hand.<lf>Are you prepared?
<string>A successful defense! Such<lf>teamwork is a thing of beauty...
<string>This is the end... We must<lf>fall back for now!
<string>This was an adequate success...<lf>Let us return to Kamura.
<string>The stronghold is in a sorry state...<lf>But not for naught.
<string>Mission complete.<lf>Excellent work indeed...
<string>You've completed every mission?<lf>A fantastic achievement.
<string>A new mission awaits your<lf>confirmation...
<string>A wave is approaching...<lf>Now then, let us purge this blight.
<string>The next wave comes.<lf>We must ready ourselves...
<string>Look, the final wave—and the<lf>home stretch of this battle...
<string>A gate is under attack.<lf>This simply won't do...
<string>They have toppled our defenses.<lf>What meddlesome foes...
<string>A horde has breached our<lf>bulwark; it must be stopped!
<string>The last remaining gate is under<lf>attack! A-At this rate—
<string>How much more can it endure?<lf>If it falls, the Stronghold falls!
<string>Foul gate-breaking beast...<lf>Let us remove it.
<string>That Stalker is targeting<lf>hunters. Stay alert...
<string>Take heed:<lf>Targeters attack hunters from afar.
<string>Wind Serpent Ibushi sighted!<lf>So, it finally shows itself...
<string>The monsters advance.<lf>Pray, be on your guard!
<string>A powerful monster approaches.<lf>It could do some damage...
<string>I can feel the power...<lf>Let us begin our offensive!
<string>The power fills me—it is<lf>incredible! The time is now!
<string>An installation was destroyed...<lf>It shall be fixed soon.
<string>An Apex has appeared. Let us<lf>disappear it and end this.
<string>The Apex is preparing a dire<lf>assault! Can we halt it!?
<string>The power of an Apex... It is<lf>truly immeasurable!
<string>The horde has been riled up by<lf>the Apex's roar. Perfect...
<string>The Apex destroys our hold...<lf>Such wanton violence...
<string>Are you alright!? We must yet<lf>mount a counteroffensive...
<string>Very good. That installation<lf>seems fit for the task.
<string>Regrettable, that installation<lf>seems to have missed the mark...
<string>Very impressive. Your efforts<lf>have us all in high spirits...
<string>Your boundless courage is why<lf>you are Kamura's hope...
<string>Ah, Master <PL>...<lf>What ferocious firepower.
<string>Your courage burns bright.<lf>May it never dim.
<string>Master <PL>, your<lf>strength is truly unmatched...
<string>I shall standby at camp. If<lf>you sense danger, hurry here...
<string>The installations are ready to<lf>be deployed at any time...
