<string>Shh! Don't say anything! I'm this close<lf>to coming up with a beautiful verse.
<string>Aren't you shopping with Hinoa?<lf>Hello! RUDE! Don't keep her waiting!
<string>Oh, hello, <PL>.<lf>You're officially a Hunter now?<lf>Congratulations.
<string>Your physical aptitude was always<lf>superior to your intellect.<lf>Hunting suits you well, I think.
<string>I'm going to keep making poetry,<lf>putting my emotions into words<lf>just as I've always done.
<string>"Kamura Hunter...<lf>Before your weapon unsheathes,<lf>Grill your steak well-done."
<string>A poem dedicated to you.<lf>Lovely, isn't it? A cinch for<lf>a poet of my caliber.
<string>My prodigious ability scares me<lf>sometimes... More so than the<lf>Rampage, to be honest.
<string>I must say, I feel so much better<lf>when I compose.
<string>Speaking of which, I recently composed<lf>a poem for Elder Fugen.<lf>*ahem*
<string>"The Elder, Fugen...<lf>Great Leader of Kamura.<lf>Laughter, heard for miles."
<string>I mean, his laughter does echo<lf>throughout the village, lifting<lf>the spirits of all who hear it.
<string>I prefer to hear it from afar, myself—<lf>too close and your ears start ringing.
<string>I heard you took on a quest from<lf>Master Utsushi. From your expression,<lf>I'm guessing you breezed through it.
<string>Master Utsushi's rather...handsome.<lf>He's kind of goofy too, but I guess<lf>that just adds to his charm.
<string>"Master Utsushi,<lf>Air charged like a Zinogre...<lf>Electrify me."
<string>I think that perfectly captures<lf>his appeal, don't you?
<string>Ah, <PL>.<lf>I must thank you. I love those Bunny<lf>Dango, and you have saved them.
<string>"Our precious dango,<lf>protected from being lost...<lf>A sigh of relief."
<string>...Shhh. No need to say anything.<lf>Let the words inspire you as your<lf>heroic act has inspired me.
<string>...And all this inspiration has<lf>made me hungry. I should go<lf>get some dango to eat.
<string>Elder Fugen was giving some Buddies<lf>an earful earlier. They must be the ones<lf>that ran off to the Shrine Ruins.
<string>"Missing buddies found.<lf>An angry demon, Fugen...<lf>Ears down and tails tucked."
<string>Put my little poetic spin on the situation.
<string>But Elder Fugen was just pretending<lf>to be angry. You know, to teach them<lf>a lesson.
<string>Still, some of the villagers were surprised<lf>by how intense he was. "An angry demon"<lf>describes him well.
<string>What? The Rampage is coming?<lf>Then I better get to the Stronghold.
<string>...What? Don't look at me like that.<lf>I'm a citizen of this village too.<lf>I'm quite prepared to defend it.
<string>I'll have you know that I'm actually<lf>quite capable with a hammer.
<string>"Shiika the Poet,<lf>wielding a mighty hammer...<lf>Behold her power!"
<string>Great work in the Stronghold.<lf>Defending outside was tough too.<lf>And rather terrifying, to be honest.
<string>Let me describe it to you...in a poem.<lf>*ahem*
<string>"I swing my hammer,<lf>Master Hojo goes flying.<lf>I am so sorry..."
<string>It was hilarious seeing Master Hojo flying<lf>through the air like, "WAAAH!" ...I swear<lf>it wasn't on purpose.
<string>I saw a drawing Master Hojo<lf>made of Magnamalo.
<string>It had one terrifying-looking face,<lf>and such evil-looking haunches.<lf>Much like the real thing, in fact.
<string>When I saw the drawing, a poem<lf>came to mind. Here, let me recite<lf>it for you. *ahem*
<string>"Magnamalo's glare,<lf>eyes burning with ferocious glow,<lf>I shiver with fear."
<string>Upon hearing that, Master Hojo<lf>shed a tear and said, "Shiika,<lf>you are a genius."
<string>I really am... *shudder*
<string>I hear you successfully hunted Magnamalo.<lf>Don't forget you owe that in part to Master<lf>Hamon and his device.
<string>Even so, it's an impressive feat.<lf>So, I've created "Ode to <PL>"<lf>to commemorate it. *ahem*
<string>"Oh, Hunter, Hunter...<lf>Monsters fall like setting sun<lf>We honor your might."
<string>Enrapturing, no?<lf>No need to hold back the tears.<lf>Shh. Go on. Let it all out.
<string>You know, it feels great to relax<lf>sometimes. Drink some tea. Enjoy<lf>some dango.
<string>A poem just came to mind!<lf>*ahem*
<string>"Pink petals falling,<lf>sweet aroma fills the air,<lf>everlasting peace."
<string>...Hmm.<lf>Not my finest work, admittedly.
<string>Master Hojo's drawings have this<lf>wonderfully unique charm. He told<lf>me he's entirely self-taught.
<string>So, I decided to make a poem<lf>in homage to him. Here, listen.
<string>"A croak can be heard.<lf>It's from the Tetsucabra?<lf>No, Master Hojo."
<string>I recited this poem to Minoto the other<lf>day. She nodded and said, "That's nice."
<string>She remained expressionless, but I bet<lf>she was masking a turmoil of emotions.

<string>Well, the Rampage approaches.<lf>Better grab my hammer and<lf>hurry to the Stronghold.
<string>I'll be "Shiika the Hammer Wielder"<lf>to defend this village once again!
<string>When the blue dragon appeared,<lf>everyone panicked. Especially<lf>Minoto, with her sister taken ill...
<string>"Minoto, my dear...<lf>We pray for your sister's health,<lf>your smile will return."
<string>Oh, how pitiful that great poems are destined<lf>to arise in times of crisis!
<string>...Also. I've never actually seen her<lf>smile. So to see it again, would<lf>actually be a first time for me.
<string>We must do something about the blue dragon,<lf>but nobody knows where it went.
<string>I've expressed this irritation as verse.<lf>*ahem*
<string>"Blue dragon hidden...<lf>We will end your reign of terror!<lf>Show yourself foul fiend!"
<string>An intensely aggressive poem,<lf>to be sure, but based on the very<lf>real frustration of the village.
<string>Besides, poetry is fundamentally<lf>the expression of emotion, after all.

<string>Once again, the Rampage approaches,<lf>interrupting my poetic flow. Guess my<lf>hammer and I are off to the Stronghold.
<string><PL>, we're counting on you.<lf>Please defeat Ibushi, for Hinoa's sake.
<string>"Wind Serpent descends,<lf>Kamura Hunter engage.<lf>No time for small talk."
<string>I put the situation into a poem...<lf>I hope I got the details right.
<string>Minoto was just here earlier. She<lf>put her face right in front of mine,<lf>and said, "Hey, look at this!"
<string>I'm wondering what's going on, then<lf>notice her eyes are glowing gold. I was<lf>so surprised, I dropped my tea.
<string>When I asked her if she was all right,<lf>she only smiled and said,<lf>"I'm resonating, just like Hinoa."
<string>I thought resonating was painful.<lf>Or, at least, that was the case<lf>with Hinoa...
<string>I don't get what's happening to Minoto.<lf>I'm so stumped, I can't even think of<lf>a poem...
<string>"Fire burning inside...<lf>Defend all that you hold dear!<lf>We believe in you!"
<string>A poem from me to you,<lf>before you do battle with Narwa.
<string>I hope it lit a fire of courage within.<lf>In exchange, all I ask is that you<lf>end the cycle of calamities with it.
<string>Hinoa and Minoto are now<lf>resonating together... Those<lf>two dragons won't let up.
<string>But the twins seem used it now.<lf>I've even seen them walking<lf>around the village in that state.
<string>"Gold and blue eyes glow,<lf>twins and dragons resonate...<lf>Is it you inside?"
<string>...And those are my feelings at<lf>present, poured into a poem.<lf>I figured you'd like to know.

<string>Since you're going to fight Ibushi<lf>and Narwa, I thought I'd compose<lf>a little something for you: *ahem*
<string>"Time to slay your foe,<lf>Will we finally be free?<lf>Hunter, bring us peace"
<string>I hope this poem has inspired you as you<lf>have inspired me. Keep these words in<lf>your heart as you go into battle.
<string>Well done, <PL>.<lf>A poem for your marvelous achievement:<lf>*ahem*
<string>"Farewell, o Rampage.<lf>Flowers bloom in Kamura...<lf>Smiles on all faces."
<string>Hmm... Not my best work. I wanted it to<lf>be a little more...touching. I'll have to get<lf>back to you when I've improved it.
<string>I must say, I feel so much better<lf>when I compose.
<string>Speaking of which, I recently composed<lf>a poem for Elder Fugen.<lf>*ahem*
<string>"The Elder, Fugen...<lf>Great Leader of Kamura.<lf>Laughter, heard for miles."

<string>Yomogi always works so hard,<lf>and in such good humor.<lf>No wonder she's so successful.
<string>Watching her inspired me to come<lf>up with a poem. It goes like this:<lf>*ahem*
<string>"Yomogi, so cute!<lf>Always chatty, never mute.<lf>dango fill my heart."
<string>Truly, this is a wonderful poem to cheer<lf>Yomogi on... I should have everyone<lf>chant this outside the Tea Shop.

<string>Komitsu comes just to listen to<lf>my poetry sometimes.
<string>Because "it makes me happy," she says.<lf>It seems my verse resonates with all sorts,<lf>even young children like her.
<string>So, I've written a poem just for our<lf>sweet little Komitsu. It goes like this:<lf>*ahem*
<string>"I'm so mean to you...<lf>How else will you notice me?<lf>I adore you so..."
<string>It expresses the feelings of a certain boy.<lf>I think you can probably guess who.
<string>But, I don't think he wants to admit it.
<string><PL>, you're looking more and<lf>more like a real hunter these days. Here,<lf>a poem for your efforts. *ahem*
<string>"Kamura Hunter...<lf>Felling monsters left and right.<lf>Always quest complete!"
<string>How do you like it? Makes you feel like you<lf>want to dash out there and hunt, no?
<string>Could you help me?
<string>I have come to a conclusion...<lf>Specifically, on how I should go about<lf>sharing my artistic gift with the world.
<string>Big things catch attention, do they not?<lf>That means, if I were to write down my<lf>poetry with a big brush, it would too.
<string>Ah, it's a shame few others will ever<lf>achieve such levels of genius as I...
<string>Anyway, I would like you to gather the<lf>materials for making such a brush.
<string>Meanwhile, I'll be composing a poem.
<string>My, that was splendid work.
<string>Ah, I see you've brought my materials.<lf>Thank you, Hunter.
<string>I've been hard at work myself, but I may<lf>have hit some sort of writer's plateau.
<string>"It is so heavy.<lf>The weight of my words inked down?<lf>No, this giant brush..."
<string>...Ugh. That actually might've been<lf>my worst composition yet.
<string>Oh, by the way: I thought it might be<lf>helpful to share that you can also<lf>forge a giant brush at the Smithy.
<string>Go and take a look at it,<lf>if you're interested.
<string>We need to defend the Stronghold...
<string>Okay, looks good to go!
